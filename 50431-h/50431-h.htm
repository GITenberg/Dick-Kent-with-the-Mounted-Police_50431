<h1 title="">DICK KENT WITH THE MOUNTED POLICE</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE SCAR FACED INDIAN</span></h2>
<p>Dick Kent tossed aside the wolf trap he had been
trying to repair, and turned to his chum, Sandy
McClaren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to your Uncle Walter&rsquo;s at Fort
Good Faith,&rdquo; said Dick restlessly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting too
quiet around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy McClaren&rsquo;s big blue eyes turned from the
marten pelt he had been scraping. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,
Dick. Uncle Walt needs us, too. He&rsquo;s still having
a lot of trouble with that outlaw, Bear Henderson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>For a year after finishing school in the United
States, Dick Kent and Sandy McClaren had been
pursuing adventure two hundred miles north of
Hay River Landing, Canada, where they had gone
to visit Sandy&rsquo;s uncle. Lately they had come to
Fort du Lac at the invitation of Martin MacLean,
the factor there. The savage northland already had
woven its spell of dangerous adventure about them,
but Fort du Lac had proved dull after the excitement
of the more lawless trading post supervised
by Sandy&rsquo;s uncle on the northern fringe of the
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company&rsquo;s territory.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy had turned toward the big log
store building where Martin MacLean bartered for
furs, when they stopped dead, looking northeast
along the trail that curved about a high headland
of pine forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Dick suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like an Indian runner!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Mr. MacLean,&rdquo; Dick stretched his athletic
legs toward the store.</p>
<p>The fur trader came out on Dick&rsquo;s heels a moment
later, his broad, bony frame and bearded face tense
at the hint of trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a runner all right,&rdquo; confirmed the trader,
watching the distant figure, which was rapidly
approaching.</p>
<p>Presently a swarthy faced Indian, his coarse black
hair streaming about his haggard features, fell
almost exhausted into their arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me carry him in,&rdquo; Martin MacLean commanded.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s tuckered out. We&rsquo;ve got to get
him to talk. There&rsquo;s trouble somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>They tugged the limp body of the runner into
the store and lay him on several bales of fur. The
trader hurried for stimulant, which he forced between
the Indian&rsquo;s teeth. The runner soon opened
his eyes. All three bent over him as he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him Bear Henderson take um post&mdash;from Mister
McClaren,&rdquo; gasped the runner. &ldquo;Tie um up. Kill
all good Injuns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Kent&rsquo;s face paled as he turned to Sandy.
&ldquo;Henderson has captured your Uncle Walter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll get his when the mounted police get
there,&rdquo; flared Sandy, his Scotch temper showing
itself.</p>
<p>The factor of the post turned to them. They fell
silent. &ldquo;Boys, I can&rsquo;t leave the post,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
I don&rsquo;t trust any of the Indians around the store.
Can I depend on you to go down the river and get
Malcolm Mackenzie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you!&rdquo; Dick and Sandy chorused, &ldquo;I should
smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what this means,&rdquo; the trader went
on sternly. &ldquo;Bear Henderson is a powerful man.
There isn&rsquo;t a doubt this runner was followed here.
There may be men right here at Fort du Lac who
are in sympathy with the outlaw. Henderson is
plotting against the whole northern frontier held by
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. It&rsquo;s life or death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; Dick cried eagerly. &ldquo;Tell us what
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then. You go by canoe down the river
to Mackenzie&rsquo;s Landing. Tell Mackenzie I asked
him to go with you to the mounted police post at
Fort Dunwoody. You know the trail that far.
Malcolm knows it from the landing on. There&rsquo;s
a grub cache he might have forgotten. In case he
has&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the boys followed MacLean behind the
counter. From the strong box the trader drew a
map. &ldquo;Now here is our post,&rdquo; the trader continued,
indicating a dot on the rough map with a match
end, while Dick and Sandy followed him attentively;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Little Moose Portage, and further down
Mackenzie&rsquo;s Landing, the free trader&rsquo;s post. Twenty
miles further the river swings north and you leave
the water and go by land. Then here&rsquo;s where you
strike the cache of food&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s sudden, startled cry interrupted. &ldquo;What
was that at the window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything,&rdquo; whispered Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you weren&rsquo;t imagining something?&rdquo; said
the trader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I saw a face right there a moment ago,&rdquo;
Dick insisted, pointing to a window in the rear of
the long store. &ldquo;It seemed to be an Indian&rsquo;s face
which was covered with hideous scars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>MacLean walked back and pulled the curtains
shut over the window. He returned and went on
explaining the location of the cache and the route
to be taken to Fort Dunwoody.</p>
<p>Once started, Dick and Sandy were not long in
preparing for the trip down the river to Mackenzie&rsquo;s
Landing. They cleaned and oiled their 30.30 Ross
rifles, packed a canoe with flour, beans, bacon, coffee,
salt, sugar and camp utensils, and saw that they
were well supplied with ammunition.</p>
<p>On their last trip to the canoe from the storehouse,
Sandy, too, had a singular surprise. But
he did not cry out. Instead, he called softly to
Dick, who was a little ahead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the same face you saw behind those boxes
over there on the landing,&rdquo; Sandy said tensely.
&ldquo;Make believe we didn&rsquo;t notice anything. Then
we&rsquo;ll pick up our rifles and walk down the river till
we get where we can see behind the boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Dick replied cooly, his dark eyes
gleaming as they always did at the promise of
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot. Capture him,&rdquo; Dick added, as they
deposited their packs into the canoe, picked up their
rifles and started off down the river bank, their eyes
bent to the left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>When they had advanced far enough to see
behind the boxes, they turned and looked. The
face was gone! There was no one behind the packing
boxes.</p>
<p>Sandy scratched his head. &ldquo;Blame it, I know I
saw somebody watching us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll look closer.&rdquo; Dick led the way
forward and they examined all the boxes, but found
each one empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks queer,&rdquo; Dick admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Indians can disappear mighty suddenly,&rdquo;
Sandy said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tell Mr. MacLean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried back to the store. The trader plainly
was deeply concerned over what they had to tell.
&ldquo;I tell you, boys, I hadn&rsquo;t ought to let you make
this trip,&rdquo; he said, pacing back and forth. &ldquo;Henderson
has men here that I know nothing about.
They say he has secret operatives all over the northern
frontier. Sandy&rsquo;s uncle never would forgive
me if anything happened to you fellows. But I
don&rsquo;t see what else I can do. The mounted police
must be notified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sandy and I aren&rsquo;t men,&rdquo; Dick replied
modestly, &ldquo;but you know we&rsquo;ve been in the north
country for a year now and so far we&rsquo;ve taken
pretty good care of ourselves. Sandy&rsquo;s Uncle
Walter will tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The trader surveyed Dick Kent&rsquo;s stalwart figure
and Sandy&rsquo;s more stocky frame with a renewal of
confidence. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I believe you
fellows will come out all right. Shake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy gripped Martin MacLean&rsquo;s hard
hand. They felt a glow of admiration for the big
&ldquo;sourdough&rdquo; who had so complimented two &ldquo;chechakos,&rdquo;
or tenderfeet. The trader drew from his
pocket a wallet of money and thrust it into Dick&rsquo;s
hand, with the remark it might come in handy for
expenses.</p>
<p>An hour later the boys were gliding down the
river, Dick in the stern steering, Sandy in front on
the lookout for snags. The dark walls of spruce
forest on either side closed in on them with a mysterious
silence. They seemed to feel malevolent eyes
watching them as they sheered the oily surface of
the stream. The strange face both had seen at Fort
du Lac remained in their memory and made them
silent as they forged along with the current. It was
the last warm days of fall; already a hint of winter
was in the air, and with the threat of danger hovering
about was combined another feeling of dread,
as if the very atmosphere of the vast, lonely land
heralded the approach of mercilessly cold weather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;You watch the south bank, and I&rsquo;ll watch the
north,&rdquo; Dick broke the silence when the landing at
Fort du Lac had faded from view around a bend.
&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll be followed by land if our suspicions
are correct and there&rsquo;s really some one on our trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have to follow by land for a ways anyway,&rdquo;
rejoined Sandy. &ldquo;Mr. MacLean will see them
if they use one of the canoes at the landing. But
I suppose they have a canoe hidden somewhere along
the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; Dick agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep sharp
watch and be ready to duck if there&rsquo;s any shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They paddled on silently for a quarter of an hour,
making good time and keeping to the center of the
stream. They were just passing a large heap of
driftwood, lodged in an eddy near the north shore,
when Sandy called Dick&rsquo;s attention to something
under the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of that light brown object
just the other side of the little sand point sticking
out into the river?&rdquo; asked Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking at it myself,&rdquo; responded Dick. &ldquo;I
thought it was a log with the bark off it at first, but
it might be a canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks a lot like a canoe&mdash;as if they tried to
hide it under some brush but the brush sprung up
after they left and exposed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn in and see,&rdquo; Dick plied his paddle
lustily, and the light craft swerved toward the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we taking an awful risk?&rdquo; Sandy was
cautious. &ldquo;Suppose they&rsquo;re close to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a chance,&rdquo; Dick returned. &ldquo;Better
take a chance now than have them catch up with
us in that canoe. It&rsquo;s plain they&rsquo;re not here yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nerves keyed high at thought of the peril they
might be floating into, Dick and Sandy bore swiftly
into the sand point, and presently the bottom of the
canoe grated on the gravel. Dick leaped out into
the shallow water and beached the canoe, Sandy
following closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a canoe sure enough!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed when
they reached the spot where they had seen the suspicious
object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they tried to hide it,&rdquo; Sandy came back, as
they drew nearer. &ldquo;See the tracks in the mud?
Say! That canoe hasn&rsquo;t been there a day, if that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; Dick cried, &ldquo;and right here and
now we&rsquo;re going to see that nobody chases us in this
canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Sandy cautioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll set her adrift,&rdquo; Dick went on, unheeding
Sandy&rsquo;s precautions. &ldquo;Here, Sandy, you grab the
bow and I&rsquo;ll get around behind and push. Soon as
we get it out in the current it&rsquo;ll float down where
they can&rsquo;t find it. We might sink it, but we&rsquo;d have
to tow it into the river and we haven&rsquo;t time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Sandy fell to work with a will. The canoe was
lodged in the mud rather securely and they strained
for some minutes before it at last came loose with
a suck and splash that nearly tumbled Sandy over.
An instant later they had shoved the canoe out into
the stream, where the current caught it and carried
it past the sand point.</p>
<p>The young adventurers paused to gaze with satisfaction
upon this blow they felt they had dealt the
enemy, when a sound from the shore drew their
startled attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; whispered Dick.</p>
<p>They could hear a crashing among the trees. Looking
toward the forest they could see nothing at first.
Then suddenly, into a small clearing that led down
to the river bank, burst three men, running and
waving their rifles menacingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! The canoe!&rdquo; cried Dick hoarsely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
stop to shoot. We&rsquo;ve got to get away. They&rsquo;re
after that canoe. It&rsquo;s the Indian with the scarred
face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy tumbled into the stern of the canoe in one
flying leap, and as Dick shoved on the prow, he
picked up his paddle and stroked backward. The
canoe left the beach with a lunge, and Dick was
nearly precipitated into the water as he leaped into
his position in the bow. As they crouched to paddle,
three shots sounded and bullets cut the water about them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Downstream fast,&rdquo; shouted Dick. &ldquo;Stay low,
Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rifle balls were flying thick and fast as they
rounded the sand point, paddling frantically after
the canoe they had set adrift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diable!&rdquo; they could hear an enraged cry in
French, as their pursuers found the canoe gone and
the boys escaping.</p>
<p>Dick turned and looked back. All three of the
men were kneeling with rifles leveled. &ldquo;Duck!&rdquo; he
shouted to Sandy just in time.</p>
<p>The rifles cracked almost as one and two bullets
ripped through the bottom of the canoe, plowing
up splinters in their wake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sprung a leak,&rdquo; called Sandy almost immediately.
&ldquo;Those shots have put the canoe out of
commission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick glanced about at the bottom of the canoe.
Sandy was right. The bullets had struck below the
waterline and the river was gurgling in around the
packs and blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">AT LITTLE MOOSE PORTAGE</span></h2>
<p>Dick Kent thought swiftly. There was no time
to lose. The canoe was filling fast. Already it was
growing perceptibly heavier. Ahead he could see
the canoe they had set adrift. It was a long chance,
but it was the only thing to be done, aside from
swimming to the other shore and abandoning all
their packs and camp equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; panted his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to switch our packs into that empty
canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch it first, I&rsquo;ll say!&rdquo; cried Sandy.</p>
<p>They redoubled their efforts on the paddles. The
drifting canoe was spinning slowly in the stream.
Waterlogged as they were, they yet were slowly
gaining on the empty craft. Out of rifle range
from the sand point, the bullets of their pursuers
no longer endangered them as they skipped across
the water yards short of their mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Slowly they overhauled the empty canoe, and at
last Dick reached out and grasped the prow, hauling
it to the side of their own sinking craft. Dropping
their paddles then, they straddled the two gunwales
and with their legs held the canoes together while
with all haste they transferred their dunnage. Working
grimly and silently they had almost finished
when the canoes began to whirl slowly in the current.
Sandy lost his balance and toppled into the
water, his hoarse shout of surprise muffled as the
river closed over his head.</p>
<p>Sandy came up from the cold bath. Dick shouted
encouragement, extending a paddle to his chum while
he alone held the canoes together. In a moment,
spluttering and shivering, Sandy crawled back into
the loaded canoe.</p>
<p>The leaking canoe was rolling on its side when
the last blanket was taken from it. The young men
picked up their paddles and struck out with all speed.
They feared their pursuers, since they no longer
appeared on the sand point, had run back into the
forest and were coming along the river bank into
rifle range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B-r-r-r, that sure was no warm bath,&rdquo; chattered
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep paddling, and warm up,&rdquo; Dick called over
his shoulder. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go ashore and dry your clothes
when we&rsquo;re sure we&rsquo;ve got away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>No sooner were the words out of his mouth when
a rifle shot sounded from the shore some distance
behind them. A bullet whined over their heads and
plunked into the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go again!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bear
toward the other shore and see if we can&rsquo;t get out
of range.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crouching over their paddles they swerved to the
right and gradually paddled out of range once more.</p>
<p>Until late in the afternoon the boys kept up a
killing pace with the paddles. Sandy, warmed by
the stiff exercise, would not permit Dick to go in
shore on his account, and so they drew into the swift
current above Little Moose Portage.</p>
<p>The canoe was beached on the shore opposite
the one where the enemy had put in an appearance
miles behind. It was an excellent camp site. They
were only about three hundred yards above the
rapids, whose swift current, filled with sharp stones,
made it necessary to go on by land to a point where
the river was less dangerous. They could hear the
sound of the rushing water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep sharp watch while we make camp,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;Those fellows may have found another
canoe and caught up with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even if they come on by land they can&rsquo;t be so
very far behind,&rdquo; Sandy added, shivering a little
now that the warming work on the paddle was discontinued.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy had paddled many miles that day
and they were very tired. A year before they could
not have kept on that far. But the north country
had hardened their already healthy bodies, until they
laughed at the exertion that would have put a southland
boy flat on his back.</p>
<p>A campfire of pine cones and dead wood soon
was crackling cheerily. Dick set on the coffee pot
and mixed up some flapjacks while Sandy took off
his moccasins and sox by the fire. By the time
Sandy was fairly dry the meal was ready, and the
boys fell to ravenously. Now and again they were
startled by some sound from the forest, but each
time the noise proved to be only that made by a wild
animal investigating their campfire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take turns on watch tonight,&rdquo; Dick said,
sipping his last cup of coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s draw straws for the first trick,&rdquo; Sandy
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dick objected, &ldquo;that ducking you had gave
you the hardest day. I&rsquo;ll take the first watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy wanted it otherwise, but Dick insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;ll be sure to wake me up when my
turn comes,&rdquo; Sandy was already yawning, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all
right with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Soon Sandy was rolled in his blankets, close by
the fire, which was welcome indeed in the chill of
the autumn evening.</p>
<p>Dick took a position in the shadow of a clump of
willows where the firelight would not reveal him to
any prowlers of the night that might investigate too
closely. Here he squatted Indian fashion, his rifle
across his knees. Many thoughts passed through his
mind as the time slowly passed. That Sandy and he
were on the most perilous mission of their lives he
knew. But contrary to being frightened by impending
danger, he was overjoyed. It was what he and
Sandy had come north for&mdash;adventure. And they
were getting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to get to Mackenzie&rsquo;s Landing day
after tomorrow,&rdquo; he mused, talking low to himself
to keep from going to sleep. It was too dangerous
to walk about. &ldquo;That means three or four more
camps before we get a guide. Gee, I wish we could
go on by ourselves. If Sandy or I only knew the
country around Fort Dunwoody&mdash;but we&rsquo;d get lost,
and we can&rsquo;t afford to lose any time with Sandy&rsquo;s
uncle in Bear Henderson&rsquo;s hands. Wonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Dick sat up suddenly, listening. It seemed to him
that above the ripple of the river water and the low
rumble of the distant rapids he heard the scrape of
a canoe bottom on the gravel. His heart leaped and
beat on painfully. What if some one stole their
canoe, or crept up and attacked them! The thought
galvanized him into action.</p>
<p>He dropped to his hands and knees, his rifle
clutched in his right fingers. It was only a short
distance to that part of the beach where they had
dragged the canoe up out of the water. Dick crawled
quietly along among the shadows to the fringe of
undergrowth bordering the beach. At first the glare
of the firelight in his eyes made all appear very dark
by contrast, but gradually his vision was adjusted,
and he could make out the vague form of the canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if it was only my imagination,&rdquo; he
mumbled, not seeing anything amiss. &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
he caught his breath. The canoe had moved!</p>
<p>Sure enough, difficult as it was to see distinctly,
he knew the canoe had rocked from side to side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could it be?&rdquo; he whispered, straining his
eyes.</p>
<p>It seemed now that he could see a darker blot of
darkness moving above the rim of the canoe, but
he was not sure. There was but one thing to do&mdash;crawl
out of the sheltering bushes and across the
sand to a point from which he could ascertain just
what was moving the canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The decision made, Dick did not hesitate a
moment. Half way to the canoe, he stopped and
lay prone on his stomach, listening and watching.
What little breeze there was blew from the canoe
toward him, so that an animal would not easily
detect his approach unless it heard him. Faintly,
Dick could hear a scratching sound, as if some sharp
instrument agitated the sand and gravel. He was
more puzzled than ever.</p>
<p>He moved on again, drawing one knee cautiously
after the other, careful that his rifle was ready for
instant firing. Ten feet further and the scratching
sound ceased suddenly. Dick was now within a few
feet of the prow of the canoe. He stopped dead still,
and, resting on his knees, raised his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he called sternly.</p>
<p>A sudden commotion followed. Around the prow
of the canoe flashed two round glowing eyes, and
a bearded, tuft-eared cat face. Dick&rsquo;s rifle crashed.
There was an inhuman squall of pain; a ball of fur
and fury bounded high into the air and fell writhing,
spitting and snarling within three feet of Dick,
who leaped to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Hi! Dick, where are you?&rdquo; It was Sandy
calling from the campfire. He had been awakened
by the gun shot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick called back, stooping
over the animal he had killed. &ldquo;Only a lynx scratching
around the canoe. Come and take a look. Gosh!
I must have hit him right between the eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy came running up, and bent over the dead
lynx. When the cat&rsquo;s last struggles ceased, the boys
hauled it into the firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was scared half to death,&rdquo; Sandy grinned
sheepishly. &ldquo;I was dreaming we were in Fort Good
Faith with Uncle Walter and about a million wild
Indians were whooping and shooting at the
stockade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bet your bottom dollar I didn&rsquo;t feel so
calm about the time that lynx came around the canoe
and looked me in the eye,&rdquo; Dick confessed. &ldquo;I never
took aim at all&mdash;just blazed away. Lucky shot I
call it. I thought it was some one trying to steal
our canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Sandy inquired, getting up
and stretching.</p>
<p>Dick drew out a fine watch which had been a
graduation present. &ldquo;Only ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he reported.
&ldquo;You can go back to bed, Sandy. My watch isn&rsquo;t
half done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young adventurers talked a few minutes after
Sandy was back in his blankets. But Sandy soon
fell asleep. In spite of the excitement brought on
by the killing of the lynx, Sandy was so tired that
he went back to sleep almost immediately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Dick looked down at the lynx. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure a
beauty,&rdquo; he whispered proudly. &ldquo;I kind of wish I
hadn&rsquo;t killed him now. It&rsquo;s a shame to kill animals
when a fellow can&rsquo;t use their fur or meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to his position in the shadow of the
willows and sat there patiently until midnight, when
it was time to awaken Sandy. The fire had died
down and he heaped more wood on it. He never
felt more wide awake in his life. Sandy was sleeping
soundly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, you&rsquo;re pretty tired,&rdquo; Dick murmured,
looking down at his chum, &ldquo;and I feel just about as
fresh as when we pitched camp. Guess I won&rsquo;t
wake you up&mdash;just let you sleep until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an affection like brotherhood between
the two boys, who had been neighbors and chums
from infancy up. And since Dick was two years
older than Sandy, he often felt somewhat like an
older brother would feel toward a younger. Perhaps
this induced Dick to resume his watch without
awakening Sandy.</p>
<p>When Dick sat down again he was sure he could
stay awake all night, but the flicker of the firelight,
the whispering silence of the forest, and the ripple
of the river were like a pleasant lullaby. Before
he knew it he was nodding, and presently he fell
sound asleep. Head drooping over his knees, Dick
slept unknowing, while the fire died down and the
deep blackness of the northland night crept over the
silent camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Sandy awakened with a start at four o&rsquo;clock. It
still was dark, as the days were shortening with the
approach of winter. He did not know why Dick
had not awakened him, and he was at first fearful
that something had happened to his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, Dick,&rdquo; he called softly, sitting up in his
blankets, trying to pierce the gloom with his eyes.</p>
<p>There came no answer. Quietly Sandy reached
out and one hand closed on his rifle. The feel of the
cold steel comforted him. He had begun to learn
what an encouraging companion a firearm can be
in those lonely climes where they are necessary if
one would live long.</p>
<p>Arising, Sandy began a search of the camp and
quickly came upon Dick, sound asleep a little
way off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho, ho,&rdquo; laughed Sandy mischievously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got one on you now, old boy. Asleep on watch, huh.
I&rsquo;ll fix you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fears relieved, Sandy&rsquo;s sense of humor
cropped out. He could not resist playing a good
joke on his chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Sandy thought a moment, then hit upon an idea,
which he quickly put into execution. The fire had
gone out, and Sandy&rsquo;s scheme was no other than
to rebuild it so close to Dick that it would sizzle the
sleeping lad&rsquo;s chin.</p>
<p>Soon Sandy had the fire crackling and snapping
within two feet of Dick&rsquo;s face, as he lay on the pine
needles where he had fallen over during the night.</p>
<p>Setting about breakfast, Sandy chuckled as he
watched Dick begin to squirm and mutter in his
sleep as the heat reached him.</p>
<p>At last Dick turned over, and flinging out one
hand, almost plunged it into the fire. Sandy cried
out sharply, and jumped forward to keep Dick&rsquo;s
hand out of the fire, when his chum leaped up wide
awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! How&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Dick stammered, blinking
his eyes.</p>
<p>Sandy doubled up with laughter. Dick soon saw
the joke and joined Sandy in a hearty laugh. Then
he quickly grew serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst thing I could have done,&rdquo; Dick
accused himself. &ldquo;Suppose Henderson&rsquo;s men had
crept up on us while I was asleep. Sandy, I&rsquo;ll never
forgive myself for this. I can&rsquo;t blame them for
shooting soldiers that sleep on guard duty&mdash;after
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind,&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s optimism came to the
front. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference. We&rsquo;re safe and
sound, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t excuse me for neglecting my duty,&rdquo;
Dick insisted. But as he reached for the tin plate
of bacon and camp bread that Sandy handed him,
Dick cheered up. &ldquo;What beats me,&rdquo; he concluded,
&ldquo;is that I was going to let you sleep till morning,
Sandy. Guess I wasn&rsquo;t as tough as I thought I
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you,&rdquo; Sandy retorted. &ldquo;Just
because you&rsquo;re a couple of years older than I you
think you ought to do all the heavy work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see that you do your night watching
after this,&rdquo; Dick promised. &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;d better
get started. If those fellows kept on after us they&rsquo;ve
had just about time enough to catch up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take the boys long to break camp. The
trail that led along the bank past the dangerous
Little Moose Rapids to safe water was on the other
bank of the river, and Dick and Sandy prepared to
paddle across. Once on the trail, they planned to
shoulder their packs and the canoe for the jaunt
over the portage. They shoved out the canoe without
mishap and were cutting across the swift current
of the Big Smokey river above the rapids, when
on the other shore, at the point where they intended
landing, Dick thought he saw a wisp of smoke
ascending, as from a campfire recently extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, do you see any one over there?&rdquo; Dick
called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see a kind of smoke haze among those little
spruce trees,&rdquo; Sandy replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I think?&rdquo; Dick went on,
sturdily plying his paddle, &ldquo;that gang is waiting for
us over there. They&rsquo;re in ambush. As soon as
we get close in they&rsquo;ll open fire. I&rsquo;ll bet I&rsquo;m right.
If I am we don&rsquo;t dare try to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no trail around the rapids on the
side we camped,&rdquo; Sandy returned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to
detour about twelve miles that way to get back to
the Big Smokey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were slowly drawing closer to the opposite
bank, the swift current pulling them downstream a
little in spite of their efforts. The boys were silent
as they drew closer, undecided which way to turn,
almost certain now that a warm reception awaited
them on the portage trail landing. Suddenly Dick
spoke cooly, but tensely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Backwater, Sandy. Don&rsquo;t act excited. We don&rsquo;t
dare go on. I just saw two rifle barrels thrust
over a hump of moss on a fallen tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy did not falter at the warning. He reversed
his paddle, as Dick was doing, and the canoe came
almost to a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to shoot the rapids!&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s voice
was like the snap of a whip as he made known his

<br /><span class="small">DICK SHOOTS THE RAPIDS</span></h2>
<p>At Little Moose Rapids the Big Smokey river
plunged through a gorge nearly a half mile long before
it finally came once more to a gentler incline
where canoeing was safe. Only the most daring of
canoeists ever risked piloting a frail craft through
this treacherous stretch of water, and many who had
dared had been drowned. Dick&rsquo;s last minute resolution
was one of desperation. Though he and
Sandy were experts with the paddle, yet they never
would have considered attempting to shoot any
rapids had death or capture not threatened them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never make it!&rdquo; the optimistic Sandy was
shaken from his cheeriness by Dick&rsquo;s desperate
resolve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo; shouted Dick, as with one strong
stroke of his paddle he swerved the canoe head on
with the current, and they sped straight toward the
gorge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>At the maneuver they heard an angry shout from
the shore that had been their destination. Even at
that distance they could detect the menace in that
cry, and with added zeal they bent to their paddles.</p>
<p>Then a rifle cracked and a ball whistled across the
water behind them. Another and another shot was
fired while they sped on swifter and swifter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting out of range!&rdquo; Dick cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; panted Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re poor marksmen, anyhow,&rdquo; Dick returned.</p>
<p>They both fell silent as they left one danger
behind, only to face one almost as threatening.</p>
<p>The river swiftly narrowed and deepened as they
swept down between the high walls of the gorge.
A sullen roar of the water against the numerous
rocks and against the solid walls could be heard.
The canoe seemed to shoot ahead like a leaf on the
wind. Louder and louder grew the sound of rushing
water. Then the boys saw the first wave of
foam and spray where the water whirled among
several huge boulders.</p>
<p>Sandy was in the bow, Dick in the stern when
they struck the first angry whirlpool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your paddle to push off the rocks,&rdquo; shouted
Dick above the rumble of the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>They scudded past a huge, wet boulder, seemed
almost flung against another, only to be whisked
into a deep pool where it was all Dick and Sandy
could do to keep the canoe from turning clear
around. Out of the pool, they danced on once more.
The rapids were clear of rocks for a space, but they
were moving so fast that it seemed no time before
they reached a giant buttress of stone that seemed
to bar the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push off,&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll backwater. Heave
now. Here we go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shaved the bluff so closely that the grind of
the canoe upon the rock could be heard. The dash
of water against the cliff showered down upon them,
and the canoe took in a bucketful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dip the water out!&rdquo; shouted Dick, while they
spun into another deep pool, the cliff behind them.</p>
<p>Sandy began frantically bailing out the water with
his hat, while Dick desperately held the canoe bow
against the current.</p>
<p>The gorge was deeper now, almost shutting out
the early morning sunlight. All about spray flew in
the air, like driving mist, and the roar of rushing
water was almost deafening. The canoe was holding
up well, yet its two occupants realized its frail
shell would be shattered to atoms if but once it was
thrown upon one of the countless rocks they seemed
to miss by inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t hit a waterfall,&rdquo; shouted Sandy
as he ceased bailing water and drew a long breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;er come,&rdquo; responded Dick daringly, swerving
the canoe this way and that with a lusty stroke
of his paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, another rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy turned from his bailing and grasped his
paddle just in time. In a crouch he met the boulder
with the end of the paddle and pushed. The canoe
forged off to the left, dodged in between two other
rocks, and once more they reached a space comparatively
straight and free from obstructions. Like an
arrow they shot onward.</p>
<p>The noise of the foaming water was fast increasing
in volume. Dick feared a waterfall, and silently
he nerved himself for it, and none too soon. Dashing
down a narrow channel and bobbing around
a curve like a cork on ocean waves, he saw ahead
a mist of spray and the rumble of falling water burst
upon his ears.</p>
<p>Sandy could not suppress a cry of terror, but
white-lipped Dick managed to hold his breath for
what was to come. &ldquo;Hold tight!&rdquo; he shouted to
his chum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold her straight, and we&rsquo;ll dive
over. We&rsquo;ve a chance. It&rsquo;s not high.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Straight toward the edge of the waterfall the
canoe shot with terrific speed. The rumble of the
water was frightful. Then they went over. One
glimpse they had of the whirlpools boiling below
the falls as the prow of the canoe swept over and
the light craft leaped into the misty air, like a ski
jumper.</p>
<p>It was only a short drop of about five feet, but
when the canoe struck the churning water, it spun
and spun about, wallowing in the foam. Dick and
Sandy were drenched to the skin in a moment. All
they could do was cling to the canoe, hoping against
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang to that rock ahead, if we go under!&rdquo; Dick
cried, above the thunder of the falls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see!&rdquo; Sandy shouted back, rubbing the
water from his eyes and coughing.</p>
<p>Then the canoe struck something submerged, and
turned over on its side, tipping Dick and Sandy into
the boiling whirlpools.</p>
<p>Dick clung to the side of the canoe as the water
washed over him. For an instant Sandy disappeared,
then Dick saw him come up, also clinging to the
canoe, which had not entirely turned over, but had
shipped so much water that it was sinking.</p>
<p>Presently, canoe and swimmers were whipped
into a deep pool below the falls, and Dick and Sandy
began desperately flinging water out of their craft.
A little later they crawled back into their canoe,
wet as half drowned rats, and Dick pushed off into
the center of the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The worst was over. Below the falls the gorge
widened out slowly and the current grew more sluggish.
For a quarter of an hour they glided on
silently without need of their paddles, except to
keep the craft in the center of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! I hope we don&rsquo;t run into any more
rapids,&rdquo; Sandy breathed more freely.</p>
<p>Dick emphatically agreed. &ldquo;Next time,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prefer facing the bullets, I think. Gee, if the
fellows back in the U. S. A. knew what we&rsquo;d just
gone through they&rsquo;d have a fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never believe it,&rdquo; Sandy opined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em believe it if we live to tell it,&rdquo;
vowed Dick, pulling extra hard on his paddle and
making the canoe leap forward like a live thing.
&ldquo;But, to change the subject, I guess we left the
enemy behind this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say so,&rdquo; Sandy came back, &ldquo;but two duckings
in two days isn&rsquo;t fair. Where can I stop off
and get dry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better keep moving till noon,&rdquo; Dick
advised. &ldquo;Then we can kill two birds with one
stone&mdash;eat and dry off too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Sandy saw the wisdom of this and fell silent,
bending his energies to the paddle. They made good
time until about noon, when they espied a sandy
shoal ahead of them that promised plenty of dry
firewood for a campfire. They drew in, beached
the canoe and made camp. An hour later, dry again
and in good spirits, they pushed off and went on
down the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems as if I smell burning wood in the air,&rdquo;
Dick remarked a couple of miles further on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do too,&rdquo; Sandy replied, &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;must be a forest
fire somewhere near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope it&rsquo;s not too near,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;a forest
fire would hold us up a while even if we are on the
river. I&rsquo;ve heard my father tell about the fires they
used to have in Oregon. They&rsquo;re no joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was about to add what he knew of forest
fires when they both sighted another canoe toiling
upstream. At that distance they could not at first
distinguish whether there was more than one in
the canoe. However, they held any stranger they
might meet a possible enemy, since Martin MacLean
had told them how far-reaching was the hand
of Bear Henderson, and so they prepared for
hostility.</p>
<p>Slowly the two canoes drew together. Sandy
quietly picked up his rifle, while Dick continued
paddling. They could now see there was but one
man in the canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there,&rdquo; Dick hailed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>The stranger waved a hand, ceased paddling,
except to hold his canoe against the current, and
waited for the boys to glide up. He was a tall man,
with long, dark hair and a leathery face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked as the canoe prows
touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackenzie&rsquo;s Landing,&rdquo; Dick replied, seeing nothing
hostile in the other&rsquo;s demeanor, and seeing no
reason why he should not reveal his destination, if
not his errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got my grub stole back river a piece,&rdquo; the
stranger said, pointing over his shoulder with one
thumb. &ldquo;Have you fellers got plenty of grub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dick answered. &ldquo;Want to eat with us?
Our grub&rsquo;s a little wet, but it swallows all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be obliged,&rdquo; the stranger returned, &ldquo;but
mebbe you wasn&rsquo;t figgerin&rsquo; to stop jest now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just had a snack,&rdquo; Dick admitted, &ldquo;but if
you&rsquo;re hungry we&rsquo;ll split what we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I jest need enough to get me to Fort du Lac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort du Lac!&rdquo; Dick and Sandy chorused. &ldquo;We
just came from there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Wal, it&rsquo;ll be nigh three days canoein&rsquo; up
river, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll need grub. No time to hunt. You
fellers didn&rsquo;t happen to run across an Injun with a
heap of scars on his face?&rdquo; the man asked, searching
their faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;A scar faced Indian!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Dick broke in with a warning look at
his chum. &ldquo;We noticed a fellow of that description
at the fort. Didn&rsquo;t think much about him,&rdquo; Dick
was cautious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellers needn&rsquo;t be afraid to tell me all you
know,&rdquo; the stranger had noticed Dick&rsquo;s reserve and
his interruption of Sandy. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t publishin&rsquo; my
business but my name&rsquo;s Slade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Malemute Slade, the scout for the mounted!&rdquo;
Dick exclaimed, for the man&rsquo;s reputation as a scout
was a fable in the north country, and many times he
had heard it spoken with awe and admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s them call me Malemute Slade,&rdquo; admitted
the tall man cooly, &ldquo;but what was that about this
here scar faced Indian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick then related the queer experiences at the fort.</p>
<p>The canoes were permitted to drift on down the
river while they talked. Malemute Slade listened
attentively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Many-Scar Jackson,&rdquo; Slade told
them when they had finished with their story. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
wanted for murder down the river a piece. But
that&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to this Henderson breakin&rsquo; loose.
That&rsquo;s news to me, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll be news for the mounted
maybe. I&rsquo;ve heard rumors f&rsquo;r a long time, but
didn&rsquo;t think much of it. A tough customer, Henderson.
You fellers wants to watch y&rsquo;r step. If I
seen any of the gang that was foller&rsquo;n you I&rsquo;ll square
up with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the keen eyes and the lean jaw of the far-famed
Malemute Slade the boys saw that which
made them confident that Slade could &ldquo;square up&rdquo;
with most any one or any number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the factor you saw us and that we&rsquo;re all right&mdash;only
got a ducking when we shot Little Moose
Rapids,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>Malemute Slade&rsquo;s eyes lighted up. He looked with
new respect at Dick&rsquo;s wiry figure. &ldquo;So you fellers
shot the Little Moose an&rsquo; come through alive&mdash;wal,
I swan. You must have toted a dozen rabbit&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a one,&rdquo; Dick replied modestly, while Sandy
grinned with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;r apt to have somethin&rsquo; worse on your hands
afore you get to Mackenzie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Malemute surprised
them. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a forest fire whoopin&rsquo; it up back
a piece, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;ll maybe hit the river afore you pass
it. There&rsquo;s a bit of smoke in the air now. Hey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy started up and looked where
Slade pointed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Nearly four hundred yards down the river a stag
had come down to drink and was standing half in
and half out of the water. The canoes were slowly
drifting down upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellers want a fresh haunch o&rsquo; venison f&rsquo;r
tonight?&rdquo; queried Malemute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; Dick and Sandy chimed, &ldquo;but the
deer&rsquo;s seen us and we can&rsquo;t get close enough for a
shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I can drop him from here,&rdquo; Malemute
Slade replied cooly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed incredulously.</p>
<p>Malemute&rsquo;s only reply was slowly to raise his
45.70 lever action rifle to his shoulder. Dick and
Sandy watched breathlessly. Motionless as a statue,
the big man took aim before his rifle crashed. As
the echo of the shot sounded in the silent forest, the
stag leaped upward and fell into the river with a
soundless splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you fellers split your grub with me, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo; on. If I had time I&rsquo;d paddle down an&rsquo;
cut a hunk off that deer. But I&rsquo;ll have to be
moochin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Malemute Slade thought nothing of the wonderful
exhibition of markmanship he had just made, and
Dick and Sandy were awed to silence as they undid
their packs and transferred half their food into the
scout&rsquo;s canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Malemute Slade paid them in king&rsquo;s coin for the
provisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably see me again afore this Henderson
business is over, but it&rsquo;s hard tellin&rsquo;,&rdquo; was
Malemute&rsquo;s parting prophecy. &ldquo;Au revoir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Au revoir,&rdquo; the boys sang out the French &ldquo;so
long,&rdquo; and started on to where the stag had fallen.</p>
<p>Late that evening, making camp at a point they
judged somewhere within fifty miles of Mackenzie&rsquo;s
Landing, the smoke of the forest fire was so strong
it made them cough. They had paddled a little way
up a small creek for the night, thinking to make
themselves more secure from a possible night attack
from Henderson&rsquo;s men, who seemed so determined
they should not get to the mounted police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re in for it,&rdquo; Dick shook his head
concernedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure feels as if we were close to a fire,&rdquo; Sandy
agreed dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll need all the sleep we can get at any
rate,&rdquo; Dick concluded, as he rolled into his blankets,
and Sandy prepared for the first watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH THE FLAMES</span></h2>
<p>That night Dick slept fitfully. The place where
they had camped was in a deep coulee, unwooded
except for a few clumps of red willow. Straight
above them, at the top of an almost perpendicular
wall of red shale and crumbling sandstone, was a
dark fringe, which marked the beginning of a
mighty forest of spruce and jack pine. Moaning
in his sleep, Dick sat up and commenced rubbing his
eyes. Then he paused to stare in open-mouthed
wonder.</p>
<p>The coulee was full of smoke. It floated around
them in a ever thickening cloud, while above,
plainly visible in the glare of the conflagration,
sweeping down from the north, he beheld a thick,
dense column of smoke, which seemed to span the
coulee like a black bridge.</p>
<p>Ten feet away, Sandy, on sentinel duty, coughed
and dug at his eyes. In alarm, Dick threw aside
his blankets and crawled hurriedly forward to consult
with his chum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;the fire is all around us.
We&rsquo;ll die like rats in a trap if we stay here. Why
didn&rsquo;t you awaken me before? Let&rsquo;s hurry back to
the river and our canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sandy laconically, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching
that. There&rsquo;s a belt of fire between us and the
river. We should never have camped so far away
from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know we thought we&rsquo;d be safer from
Henderson&rsquo;s men up here,&rdquo; Dick replied.</p>
<p>The boys could hear plainly the howling of the
wind and the distant, thunderous roar of the fire.
Accustomed as he had become to danger since his
sojourn in the north, Dick could not overcome a
sudden feeling of fear and apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will we go?&rdquo; shivered Sandy. &ldquo;It seems
to be all around us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go through it somehow,&rdquo; Dick
answered, not altogether sure, himself, what ought
to be done. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous to remain here any
longer. What do you think is best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy, eyes running water, scratched his head
in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could get to the river,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d
be safe. I don&rsquo;t see any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>A few moments later, two disconsolate figures
clambered up the side of the coulee and struck off
hurriedly at right angles with the fire. With a
catch in his throat, Dick perceived the huge walls
of flames bearing down upon them. For several
miles, at least, they were cut off from the river.
Even the sky glowed dully like a large orange disk
through a thick blanket of smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy, suddenly starting
back.</p>
<p>Something had shot past them through the underbrush&mdash;a
heavy body, hurtling along in mute terror.
Almost immediately came other bodies, small and
large&mdash;rabbits scurrying almost between their legs;
deer, jumping past in a wild stampede; bear and
moose, crashing their way forward in a cumbersome,
heart-stirring panic, as they ran from the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re afraid, it&rsquo;s about time we were,&rdquo;
Sandy declared grimly, through set teeth. &ldquo;If this
smoke gets any worse we&rsquo;ll be suffocated in another
ten minutes. My throat feels as if I had been drinking
liquid fire for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty feet away a flying ember settled down on
the dry grass and immediately burst into flames.
With the ever increasing velocity of the wind, similar
patches of fire sprang up around them on every
side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Dick, fighting bravely against
mounting despair, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ll never make it. I
never saw such a wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy did not reply. With handkerchiefs pressed
to their noses and mouths, the boys struggled forward
for another quarter of a mile.</p>
<p>By this time the heat had become terrific. Dick&rsquo;s
face felt as if it had been washed in a bucket of
lye. Sandy&rsquo;s cheeks were streaked with tears, not
tears of grief, but tears of misery from smoke-tortured,
bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; choked Sandy, plunging down a short
embankment with Dick at his heels. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about
ready to quit. You see,&rdquo; he explained, struggling
with the lump in his throat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting dizzier
and dizzier every minute. This heat and smoke is
getting me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick put out his hand with an assurance he did
not feel, and patted his chum on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck up,&rdquo; Dick encouraged, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get out of
this somehow. I tell you, Sandy, we&rsquo;ve got to do
it. Maybe this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Dick never finished what he was about to say.
His foot slipped, and with a startled exclamation,
he pitched forward, completely upsetting Sandy. In
a moment both boys had rolled and slid down a steep
bank. It seemed there was no end to the fall, and
Dick&rsquo;s heart almost failed him as he thought of what
fate might meet them below. Perhaps they were
rolling toward the brink of a cliff hundreds of feet
high, perhaps they would fall into some rock cluttered
canyon, or again, they might be drowned in
some deep lake at the bottom of the bank.</p>
<p>Then they reached the bottom with a jarring impact
that shook the breath from their bodies. When
they recovered enough to look each other over, Dick
was sitting upright, astride of Sandy, who lay in a
crumpled, groaning heap under him. Dick heard,
or thought he heard, the trickle of running water.
His right foot felt pleasantly cool. When he put
out his hand to investigate his fingers encountered
water.</p>
<p>Sandy was half submerged in a tiny pool, and
was sinking fast, before Dick could pull him back to
safety. Dazed from the fall, Sandy sputtered a
moment, then inquired excitedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we got to the bottom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;At any rate there
seems to be a sort of creek running along here. Are
you all right, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I&rsquo;m not, I soon will be,&rdquo; answered
Sandy, more cheerfully. &ldquo;Wait till I get a drink
of this water. Boy, I&rsquo;m dry. Do you think we&rsquo;ll
be safe here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>By way of answer, Dick pointed up to the wide
belt of fire. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s closer than it was before. We&rsquo;re
protected down here from the heat and smoke, but
that won&rsquo;t last long. In two hours this place will
be as hot as a stove. Our only chance is to keep
on moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to leave this water,&rdquo; said Sandy, gulping
large mouthfuls of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend leaving the water,&rdquo; Dick assured
him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just occurred to me that our best plan
will be to follow this little creek. It&rsquo;s probably fed
from a spring and will eventually run either into a
lake or river. Once we get into more water we&rsquo;ll
be pretty safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy thought Dick was right, and a few minutes
later, greatly refreshed, they set out again,
following the creek downstream.</p>
<p>Two miles further on the creek ran into a larger
stream, and a little later as they hurried around
a curve, Sandy, who was in the lead, gave vent to
an exclamation of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The fire has cut in
ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Sandy was right. Not more than a quarter mile
downstream, the fire was raging on both sides of the
creek, and even as they looked, a large jack pine,
flaming to the top of its highest branches, swayed
suddenly in the wind and went crashing forward
in a shower of sparks and burning embers.</p>
<p>Sick at heart, the two young adventurers stood for
a short time, scarcely daring to think of their predicament.
Apparently there was little chance of
escape, the main body of the fire behind them,
another fire sweeping ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get through,&rdquo; Dick muttered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take a chance, Sandy. The fire ahead
hasn&rsquo;t been burning long and it&rsquo;s not as far through
it&mdash;maybe not more than a hundred yards. Somehow,
I feel certain that this creek will take us
straight on to the Big Smokey where we left the
canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s face brightened a little. &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re
right, Dick. If a burning tree or branch doesn&rsquo;t
fall on us, we can make it. We&rsquo;ll have to wade right
down through the center of the stream. If it gets
too hot we can dive under the water. I&rsquo;m going
to take off my shirt, soak it in water and breathe
with it around my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; approved Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>A half hour later, two boys emerged, wet and
blackened, from a cloud of smoke and flame and
advanced painfully along the creek to a point where
it emptied into the Big Smokey river. Behind them
thundered the terrible conflagration, getting closer
every moment. Moose, deer and caribou stood
trembling at the river&rsquo;s edge, or struck boldly out
into the stream. The boys turned north and followed
the river for a mile before they discovered the object
they sought. It was daylight now, though the smoke
made it difficult to see far. Yet the light, graceful
Peterboro canoe, loaded with supplies, did not miss
their searching eyes. As they pushed it into the
river and climbed in, Dick Kent gave voice to a
fervent exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made it, Sandy!&rdquo; he exulted, as he dipped
his paddle once more into the bosom of the Big
Smokey.</p>
<p>Sandy was about to share Dick&rsquo;s rejoicing, when
the movements of a huge brown bear, which had
splashed into the water behind them, attracted his
attention. The bear was swimming straight for the
canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shove out quick!&rdquo; cried Sandy suddenly, but
too late.</p>
<p>The brown bear, blinded by smoke, and thinking
the canoe some log to cling to, clawed at the rim
of the frail craft and pulled down. The canoe went
over, spilling its contents into the river, while the
bear, finding the craft unstable, swam on out into
the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">MACKENZIE&rsquo;S LANDING</span></h2>
<p>The plunge into the river revived both Dick and
Sandy. Gasping, they came up for air, only to
breathe the choking smoke and gases of the burning
forest. They knew that the canoe was upside down
and that their packs were in the bottom of the river.
The bear was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Sandy?&rdquo; called Dick, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; Sandy replied, a bit faintly.</p>
<p>Among the burning brands sizzling in the water,
and the flying sparks, they struggled with the canoe.
In a few minutes they had righted it, though it was
half full of water. The paddles, they could see, had
gone with the packs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for a paddle!&rdquo; shouted Dick. &ldquo;They must
be floating around somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I see one,&rdquo; Sandy dived off as he spoke,
and swam back quickly with a paddle in one hand.</p>
<p>But look as they did they could not locate
the other paddle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t look any longer. We&rsquo;ll have to change
off with one paddle,&rdquo; Dick called a little later.</p>
<p>Dick paddling, they started on. The heat still
was stifling, but they felt that the air was growing
cooler. The wind seemed in their faces, which
would tend to bear the fire back along the river.
Wild animals of all kinds still could be seen in the
water, wallowing along the shore or swimming the
stream. But they had no more dangerous encounters
with the frightened beasts.</p>
<p>Two hours of paddling, shifting the paddle back
and forth between them as soon as one grew tired,
and they came to a comparatively clear stretch of
water. Here the fire was deeper in the forest, and
had not eaten out to the bank yet. In greedy gasps,
Dick and Sandy drew in the gusts of cool, pure air
that were wafted over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look back, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick called.</p>
<p>The whole sky was a mass of red flames behind
them, and an ocean of smoke was rolling ceaselessly
upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mackenzie&rsquo;s Landing can&rsquo;t be much further,&rdquo;
Sandy said when they had looked their last upon the
great fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we ought to make it by night. We&rsquo;ll have
to make it or camp without grub or blankets. I
prefer going on,&rdquo; Dick stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Sandy rejoined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Some distance further on, as they rounded a huge
bend in the stream, they could not suppress a cheer.
In the distance they could see the shoulder of a high,
barren bluff which was the ten-mile landmark on the
trip to Mackenzie&rsquo;s Landing.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when in the distance
they at last viewed the stockade and roofs of Malcolm
Mackenzie&rsquo;s trading post. Blackened and
disheveled, nearly exhausted, they guided their canoe
to the pier, where three half-breeds were watching
them curiously. The half-breeds helped them secure
their canoe, and listened without comment to some
of their story of the eventful journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malcolm Mackenzie, he sick,&rdquo; one of the half-breeds
told them. &ldquo;No can go. Him burned bad
when fight with fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; Dick turned to Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;just our luck. Now what?&rdquo; Sandy
returned, a little disheartened, as the half-breeds led
the way into the stockade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk to Mr. Mackenzie, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Dick
asked one of the men, as they entered the post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Presently, they were ushered into a room smelling
of liniment and arnica. On a bunk lay Malcolm
Mackenzie, his head and one arm swathed in bandages.
Evidently he was suffering considerably
from serious burns. He turned his head as the boys
came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear Henderson has captured Fort Good Faith,&rdquo;
Dick blurted out. &ldquo;My friend&rsquo;s uncle has been imprisoned.
Mr. MacLean sent us to you. He said
you would lead us to the mounted police post at
Fort Dunwoody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve feared this,&rdquo; Malcolm Mackenzie&rsquo;s eyes narrowed,
&ldquo;but you see how it is with me, boys. I
can&rsquo;t travel. Got some bad burns while fighting
that forest fire. But I can send an Indian who
knows the trail.&rdquo; He turned to one of the half-breeds,
who was standing behind Dick and Sandy.
&ldquo;Send in Little John Toma,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>A little later Dick and Sandy saw a young Indian
enter. He was handsome in a dark, inscrutable way,
and though not very tall, was powerfully built. He
stood respectfully at attention, seeming more intelligent
than many of his kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma,&rdquo; Mackenzie spoke, &ldquo;I want you to lead
these young men to Fort Dunwoody as fast as you
can. Travel light. You ought to make it in four
days if everything goes right.&rdquo; He turned back to
the boys. &ldquo;Did MacLean say anything about a
cache of grub along the way?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dick reached into his pocket and drew out
the map the trader had drawn indicating the position
of the cache of food on the trail to Fort Dunwoody.</p>
<p>Mackenzie took the map, glanced at it and handed
it to Toma. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on Limping Dog Creek,&rdquo; said
Mackenzie, &ldquo;just where that gorge you follow intersects
the stream. You know the place.&rdquo; To Dick
and Sandy: &ldquo;Introduce yourselves and get acquainted.
Toma will get everything ready for you
to go on. Take a rest as soon as you eat. Oh,
Calico, Calico!&rdquo; he called to some one.</p>
<p>As the boys and Little John Toma passed out,
a large, waddling Indian woman came in. They
heard Mackenzie instructing her to get a meal ready
for his visitors before the bear-skin curtain dropped
behind them and they found themselves in the
spacious living room of the post.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy awkwardly introduced themselves
to the young Indian who was to be their guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to meet,&rdquo; Toma surprised them by saying,
his teeth flashing whitely in a smile.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy quickly felt that they were going
to like Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s the son of a chief,&rdquo; Sandy said to
Dick, when the young Indian had gone, and they
were busy at the wash bench, scrubbing off some
of the smoke and ashes of the forest fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The boys ate heartily of the food the Indian
woman placed before them on the rough board
table. As soon as they were through they were
shown to a comfortable bunk behind moose-hide
curtains. Scarcely had they lay down when they
fell into sound slumber.</p>
<p>It seemed to Dick Kent that he had only been
asleep a moment when a hand, gently shaking his
shoulder, awakened him. He looked up into the
smiling face of Toma, the young guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to go,&rdquo; said Toma. &ldquo;You wake up other
fella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the curtains fell, and Toma disappeared, Dick
turned and shook Sandy.</p>
<p>An hour later they bid goodbye to Malcolm
Mackenzie and wished him speedy recovery from his
burns. The canoe lay ready packed with provisions
at the landing when they arrived there. Toma was
starting to push off. Dick and Sandy hopped in,
and Toma sprang lightly into the bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for Fort Dunwoody,&rdquo; Dick breathed a
sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t an optimist,&rdquo; Sandy added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say
we aren&rsquo;t there yet by a long shot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Toma silently sculled the craft into the center of
the river, and they were once more floating down
the stream. The boys marveled at Toma&rsquo;s deftness
with the paddle, though they themselves were
experts. The young Indian seemed able to make
the canoe fly with his quick, powerful strokes.</p>
<p>A half hour of paddling and the roofs of Mackenzie&rsquo;s
Landing had disappeared in the haze of the
morning, and once more the walls of the silent
spruce forest closed in on either side of them.</p>
<p>Late that night they camped some twenty miles
from the trading post, in a little clearing at the
river&rsquo;s edge. Toma mentioned &ldquo;bear sign,&rdquo; and so
they hung up their flour and bacon on a tree bough
for fear a bear might get it.</p>
<p>Sandy kept first watch while Toma and Dick
slept.</p>
<p>It was a dark night. Only the stars were out, and
when the fire died down Sandy scarcely could see
a dozen paces from the camp. Occasionally he
glanced into the shadows, listening to the mysterious
sounds of the forest, and starting up at each crackle
of a twig or rustle of undergrowth.</p>
<p>Sandy wondered if the men on their trail had been
thrown off, and imagined what he would do if they
would suddenly attack. As he thought of the
dangers threatening Dick and him, his hand tightened
on his rifle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>It was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock, the time he was to
call Toma for the second watch, when Sandy became
conscious of some sinister presence. Before he
really saw or heard anything, he shivered and looked
fearfully about into the gloom of the forest.</p>
<p>A scratching and grunting noise attracted his
attention to the tree where they had hung up the
flour and bacon. It seemed he could hear the shuffle
of heavy feet and the wheeze of giant lungs as he
listened intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t call Dick and Toma,&rdquo; thought Sandy.
&ldquo;It may be only my imagination. I&rsquo;ll go see what
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heart beating wildly, Sandy commenced to creep
toward the point he had heard the noises. He could
see nothing in the dark, yet as he strained his eyes
it seemed to him that one portion of the blackness
was blacker than the rest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he heard the crashing of a splintered
tree bough. A low, vibrating growl followed, and
Sandy dropped upon his stomach. There came a
slapping, thumping sound, then an angry growling
and tussling. The dark blot lurched downward.
Sandy raised his rifle and blazed away at the shape.
A rambling roar rose in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick! Toma!&rdquo; cried Sandy, as he turned about
and fled, hearing behind him the rush of a heavy
body pursuing him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">A GRIZZLY SHOWS FIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Toma and Dick were already on their feet when
Sandy rushed toward them out of the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bear, a giant bear!&rdquo; cried Sandy. &ldquo;Run!
I&rsquo;ve wounded him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The angry roar behind Sandy was all that was
needed for Dick and Toma to take to their heels
with alacrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up tree, get up tree!&rdquo; Toma called to them.</p>
<p>Faster than they ever before had climbed a tree,
Dick and Sandy shinned up one in the dark. The
bear charged beneath them in the underbrush. The
huge beast wheeled on finding his prey had taken
to the trees and circled the trunk which supported
Dick and Sandy. Toma&rsquo;s calm voice came through
the gloom from a near-by tree:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him grizzly all right,&rdquo; Toma told them. &ldquo;You
stay in tree. I get down to rifle pretty quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely must have wounded the bear,&rdquo; Dick
whispered to Sandy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard they won&rsquo;t attack
unless they&rsquo;re wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I did,&rdquo; Sandy came back
breathlessly. &ldquo;I just blazed away and ran. Believe
me, I don&rsquo;t want to go down there again while that
monster is wandering around looking for me. He&rsquo;d
chew us up in about two bites and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick knew that Sandy&rsquo;s caution bump was working
again, and he smiled in the dark. He did not
intend to let Toma go down after the bear alone.
Yet he believed the young Indian would protest if
he revealed his intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got your rifle?&rdquo; Dick called to Toma, not intimating
his resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got gun,&rdquo; Toma called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d thought to bring mine along,&rdquo; Dick
muttered, &ldquo;but then it takes an Indian to shin up a
tree with a heavy rifle in his hand I suppose. Anyway
I have my knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go down, Dick,&rdquo; whispered Sandy, as the
bear crashed about in the brush below them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Sandy, I&rsquo;ve got as much chance as
Toma. We can&rsquo;t let that bear wreck our camp.
That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go down too,&rdquo; Sandy stubbornly decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>They could not hear Toma&rsquo;s movements with the
bear making so much noise, but Dick suspected the
guide already had slipped down from his tree and
was stalking the wounded grizzly, perhaps close
enough to get in a fatal shot.</p>
<p>Presently, they could hear the bear make off into
the gloom toward the campfire. When Dick and
Sandy dropped down out of the tree, the bear seemed
to be on the other side of the campfire, clawing and
mouthing over their dunnage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better stay up in the tree,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your tintype,&rdquo; Sandy snapped. &ldquo;If you
go, I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, we&rsquo;ve got to get our guns,&rdquo; said
Dick. &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s right where I got out of my blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I dropped mine just before I started
climbing the tree,&rdquo; Sandy was feeling around in the
dark. &ldquo;Yes, here it is,&rdquo; was his triumphant call.</p>
<p>Toma seemingly had vanished. Since his last
words, they had heard nothing more from him.
Dick judged the guide was stalking the bear from
some other direction. At any moment he expected
to hear the report of the Indian&rsquo;s rifle, and see the
flash of it in the gloom.</p>
<p>Sandy alone armed, save for Dick&rsquo;s hunting knife,
the boys began a stealthy advance toward the camp
where they could hear the bear slashing and groveling
about, evidently in some pain, for they were sure
now that Sandy&rsquo;s shot had taken effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The coals of the campfire shed a faint glow. As
the boys drew nearer, on hands and knees, they
could see the bulk of the grizzly outlined. He seemed
a mammoth of his kind, and indeed was a fearful
beast to meet in the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s wrecked our camp outfit,&rdquo; Dick muttered.
&ldquo;Careful, Sandy, don&rsquo;t get too close. Let&rsquo;s
wait till he gets away from the fire a little further,
then I can get my rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, when
Toma&rsquo;s rifle crashed in the dark on the left, and
Dick and Sandy saw a streak of flame, and heard
the roar of the bear, plainly hard hit. The grizzly
rose upon his hind legs and turned toward the spot
he believed his enemy was hidden. Then Sandy leveled
his rifle and fired, drawing bead as best he could
just under the huge beast&rsquo;s forelegs.</p>
<p>At this second shot, the bear seemed undecided
just which way to charge. He stopped, his head
turning from side to side, growling horribly, not hit
hard enough to fall.</p>
<p>Toma shot again, then Sandy. The grizzly
dropped to all fours, and began clawing at his breast.
Toma shot again from another position. The bear
rose up again with a roar of pain and rage and
started for Dick and Sandy, who turned to flee.
Then the big beast, without any apparent reason
whatsoever, wheeled about and made off into the
forest in the opposite direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hit hard!&rdquo; cried Dick, hurrying forward.</p>
<p>Toma came out of the gloom like a shadow. &ldquo;He
go off die,&rdquo; said the Indian. &ldquo;Be careful he no come
back. I go see where he go.&rdquo; Toma disappeared
after cautioning the boys to stay where they were
until he returned.</p>
<p>The minutes passed slowly while Dick and Sandy
waited the return of Toma. Finally Dick grew impatient
and was about to go on to the campfire for
his rifle, when Toma appeared again, as if he had
risen out of the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She all right,&rdquo; Toma reported. &ldquo;Him keep going.
Him die somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relieved, Dick and Sandy approached the campfire.
Toma already was heaping on more wood.
As the flames leaped upward, and the light chased
away some of the surrounding shadows, Dick and
Sandy breathed freely once more. However, sleep
was far from them after the narrow escape from
being clawed by the wounded bear. They ventured
about to see what damage the big grizzly had
effected.</p>
<p>They found Dick&rsquo;s and Toma&rsquo;s blankets torn to
shreds. The coffee pot was crushed flat and the
sugar sack broken open, its contents scattered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Dick hurried to the bough where they had hung
the flour and bacon. &ldquo;Hey, look here&mdash;Sandy,
Toma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They joined Dick. The bough had been broken
down; the flour was scattered about as if the sack
had exploded; the bacon was gone. Searching about
in the gloom they found hunks of chewed rind
among the pine needles. Only one small chunk of
bacon was left, and this they preserved in one of
their knapsacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him no hungry,&rdquo; Toma grunted, &ldquo;him play.
Him chew bacon up, spit him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he did us plenty of damage all right,&rdquo; Dick
said ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we were in for a hungry spell,&rdquo; Sandy
added, resignedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! We have bear steak for breakfast,&rdquo;
Toma exclaimed significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call justice,&rdquo; Dick laughed.</p>
<p>All three went back to the campfire then and
squatted around the crackling flames. The excitement
had loosened Toma&rsquo;s tongue, it seemed, and he
began telling stories of other bears he had known,
and whom his father had known. Dick and Sandy
listened with rapt interest to the simple tales of the
young Indian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Almost the balance of the night passed with
Toma&rsquo;s droning voice relating thrilling adventures
among the tribes in the far north. Toward dawn
Sandy turned in for an hour or so of rest, but Toma
and Dick remained awake.</p>
<p>The sun had scarcely topped the distant forest
skyline when Dick and Toma awakened Sandy, and
all three gathered up what they could of the wreckage
remaining of their provisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we gettum bear steak,&rdquo; Toma said.</p>
<p>In single file they followed the gliding figure of
the guide, as he set off on the trail of the grizzly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that track!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed presently, pointing
with his rifle at a spot of soft leaf-mold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bear track, all right,&rdquo; conceded Sandy, &ldquo;&mdash;and
look! There&rsquo;s blood on that bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure hit him a lot of times&mdash;I mean you and
Toma,&rdquo; Dick corrected. He felt disappointed that
he had not actually been in on the killing of the
bear, since he had had no rifle. But the thrill of
trailing a wounded grizzly made him forget.</p>
<p>Toma seemed to follow the trail as if by instinct.
Where Sandy and Dick could see no sign whatever,
Toma went unerringly forward, always with that
gliding, noiseless, pigeon-toed pace, that seemed tireless,
though it was kept up with an ease and speed
that made Dick and Sandy run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>For a half mile they wound among the trees, beginning
to come upon spots where the bear had
dropped down to rest. At these points the blood was
drying in large clots. Finally, approaching a fallen
tree, they came upon the grizzly, stone dead!</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy were about to cheer, yet the actual
sight of the bear made them a little sad. The great
monarch of the forest never again would proudly
tread the forest aisles. Yet the boys felt a certain
satisfaction in having won in a battle with such a
powerful foe.</p>
<p>Toma immediately began skinning one haunch of
the great bear. &ldquo;Him old and tough,&rdquo; grunted
Toma, &ldquo;but we cook um long time. That make um
tender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed. &ldquo;The old boy will make stringy
eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could take his hide,&rdquo; Sandy sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure would knock the eyes out of the fellows
back home,&rdquo; Dick said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time to skin,&rdquo; Toma interrupted. &ldquo;Hide too
heavy carry. Mister Mackenzie say mus&rsquo; travel
light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s impossible for us to have the old fellow&rsquo;s
hide, but that&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t have
his scalp.&rdquo; Suiting his action to his words, Dick
drew his sharp hunting knife and stooped over the
head of the wilderness king. With Sandy&rsquo;s help they
took the old grizzly&rsquo;s scalp, ears and all, as a trophy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours and Toma&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Dick smiled, when they
had finished. He held the scalp out to Sandy.</p>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s eyes lightened. &ldquo;Let Toma have the
scalp. I&rsquo;ll take the claws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s hunting knife once more came into play.
The bear&rsquo;s claws measured as long as five inches, and
Sandy was exceedingly proud as he at last pushed
them into a side pocket of his leather coat.</p>
<p>Toma was waiting when they had finished. The
guide had his knapsack filled with the tenderest
steaks he could cut.</p>
<p>At a jog trot they set out for the river and their
campsite, and soon they were grilling bear steaks
over the fire.</p>
<p>When they broke camp they had provisions for
two scanty meals, including some of the bear steaks
which they saved from breakfast. The canoe
packed, they once more set out down the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We make um grub cache tomorrow,&rdquo; Toma encouraged
them. &ldquo;Get um plenty grub there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Late that afternoon, without mishap they reached
a point where Toma said they must abandon their
canoe and go on by land, since the river swung off
in another direction. They carefully hid their canoe
in some underbrush along with two others left by a
party that had recently gone on ahead of them, and
started out on foot.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy were very tired long before Toma
showed signs of slowing up, but they gamely stuck
to the pace without complaint.</p>
<p>They were angling down the side of a long ravine,
toward a spring, which Toma muttered would be a
good place to camp, when of a sudden, the guide
stopped dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hide quick!&rdquo; Toma whispered, with a significant
gesture of one sinewy brown hand.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy crouched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think um bad fellas ahead,&rdquo; Toma explained.
&ldquo;You stay here. I go ahead; look um over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy were glad to sink down and rest
their weary legs. But the warning in Toma&rsquo;s voice
did not escape them. They were keyed to sharp
watchfulness as Toma dropped to his hands and
knees and disappeared silently among the bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE RIFLED CACHE</span></h2>
<p>Dick and Sandy had crouched in hiding for upwards
of a half hour before Toma returned. He
came as he had gone, silently, like a ghost almost, so
stealthy were his movements, so clever his woodcraft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo; whispered Dick, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two, t&rsquo;ree&mdash;five bad fellas,&rdquo; Toma counted on
his fingers. &ldquo;One Pierre Govereau lead um. They
got um spring for tonight. We go round um. Got
to. Them fellas friends Bear Henderson. They
watch um trail for police. &rsquo;Fraid police go to Fort
Good Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy exchanged glances. Their weariness
was temporarily forgotten in this new peril.
They began to understand the far-reaching power of
the man who had captured Sandy&rsquo;s uncle and had
taken possession of Fort Good Faith on the edge
of the northern wilderness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;We go,&rdquo; Toma urged, his only excitement revealed
by the swift movements of his eyes as they
roved this way and that.</p>
<p>Silently the Indian guide melted into the underbrush,
Dick immediately behind him, Sandy in the
rear. For nearly two hundred yards they went onward,
almost at snail&rsquo;s pace. It was twilight now.
Long shadows of tree and bush stretched everywhere.</p>
<p>At last Toma signaled for them to stop. Dick and
Sandy dropped flat. Not more than three hundred
feet ahead a campfire twinkled through the trees,
and, motionless, between them and the fire, stood a
silent figure, with rifle on his shoulder. It was a
guard. Dick divined the figure, so like the tree
trunk against which it stood, had even escaped the
sharp eyes of Toma at first.</p>
<p>Four men were sitting around the campfire, and
they could hear the mutter of gruff voices. Once or
twice a louder than usual exclamation in French
arose above the other sounds. It seemed the leader
of the party was haranguing his men, or disciplining
one of them.</p>
<p>Suddenly Dick started and clutched Sandy&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That guard!&rdquo; he exclaimed under his breath.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the scar faced Indian!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Sandy paled a little. It seemed almost impossible
that the Indian could have gotten ahead of them.
His appearance was as mysterious as had been their
glimpses of him at Fort du Lac and along the Big
Smokey river.</p>
<p>Toma was motioning for them to bear to the
right. They crawled off after the guide in that direction.</p>
<p>Neither Dick nor Sandy knew which of them made
too much noise, or revealed some part of his body,
yet they had crawled no further than a dozen paces
when the guard moved, turned and looked straight
at them. Toma, watching over his shoulder, fell flat,
Dick and Sandy following his example. Had they
been seen?</p>
<p>The guard, his rifle ready for use, started slowly
toward them. Tensely, Dick and Sandy watched
Toma for a sign as to what course to take. They
saw Toma slowly turn to his side. The guide swung
his rifle to his shoulder as he lay.</p>
<p>Just as the guard cried out, Toma fired.</p>
<p>The scar faced Indian whirled, dropped his rifle
and fell to his knees, clutching at one shoulder.
Dick and Sandy got a glimpse of the men at the fire
leaping up and snatching their rifles, as they took to
their heels after Toma.</p>
<p>For several minutes they sprinted in the wake of
the young Indian&rsquo;s flying heels, hearing behind the
crash of their pursuers through the underbrush, and
their cries to one another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Then, before a hollow tree, half covered by the
dead branches of a lightning-blasted pine tree, Toma
halted suddenly. He motioned to them to follow and
disappeared into the half-obscured hole in the tree.
Dick and Sandy slipped in after him. There was
barely enough room in the tree for three to stand
upright, but they managed to crowd in, while Toma
quickly arranged the dead branches over the hole
until their hiding place was entirely covered from
view.</p>
<p>The distant shouts grew louder, as the men beat
the brush looking for them. Two came closer and
closer, until at last they stopped before the hollow
tree, so near that the three hidden feared their heavy
breathing might be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I saw &rsquo;em go this way,&rdquo; one said, in a
harsh voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe so,&rdquo; the other, apparently an Indian, answered.
&ldquo;It look like they jump in air an&rsquo; fly
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pierre sure will give us the devil if we let &rsquo;em get
away,&rdquo; said the first. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t blame him. Henderson
will skin him alive if these trails aren&rsquo;t kept
clean of Hudson&rsquo;s Bay men and mounties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see bush move over d&rsquo;er!&rdquo; the Indian ejaculated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>The two men moved off in another direction, and
the boys in the hollow tree breathed easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No go yet,&rdquo; Toma advised. &ldquo;Wait till all quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minutes passed slowly while they waited in
their cramped position. The shouts of the searchers
grew fainter as they apparently abandoned the chase.
Presently all was still. Toma peeped out through
the branches covering the entrance to the hollow tree.
After looking carefully about, the guide pushed back
the branches and stepped out. Dick and Sandy followed.
They were learning lessons in woodcraft
every hour from this child of the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to go back to the camp, steal up
close and see if we can&rsquo;t learn something of your
Uncle Walter, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it worth the risk?&rdquo; Sandy came back. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
we do better by hurrying on to Fort Dunwoody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true we can&rsquo;t do much without the aid of the
mounted police,&rdquo; Dick studied. &ldquo;Yet I&rsquo;d like to
know, if it&rsquo;s possible, just what has been done with
your uncle&mdash;how they&rsquo;re treating him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick asked Toma what he thought of trying to
learn something by eavesdropping. &ldquo;If you think
um best thing do,&rdquo; Toma replied. &ldquo;That scar face
got best ears of all. He wounded now. Not much
good; what say I try?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ve done plenty of this already, Toma,&rdquo;
Dick was firm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go this time. You wait here
where you can cover me with your guns if I am
detected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma, assured Dick was determined to go, grunted
his assent, and a moment later Dick disappeared
into the bushes on his perilous venture. Sandy and
Toma crawled back to within gunshot of the camp,
where the men had gathered again, gesticulating to
one another, plainly undecided what to do.</p>
<p>When Dick left his chum and the guide he realized
the danger he faced. Yet he knew any information
he might gain would be more than valuable to the
police when once he got in touch with them. Govereau&rsquo;s
men were talking so loudly that he had little
trouble in overhearing them. The leader&rsquo;s heavy
voice broke out in French, which disappointed Dick,
for he knew very little French. Then Govereau
changed to broken English, evidently for the benefit
of a member of his band who did not understand
French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go on queeck, ketch them,&rdquo; Govereau was
saying. &ldquo;Sure t&rsquo;ing them fella are zee ver&rsquo; ones
come from Fort du Lac. That devil Many-Scar an&rsquo;
them others&mdash;they let zem get through Little Moose,
I bat. We go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The four began breaking camp hurriedly. The
scar faced Indian was reclining with one arm in a
crude sling. He arose with the others and rolled up
his blanket with one hand, as if nothing were wrong
with him.</p>
<p>Dick was disappointed in not hearing anything
regarding the situation at Fort Good Faith. But, as
he could think of nothing to do about it, he edged
about and crept back to Sandy and Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re breaking camp,&rdquo; he told his companions.
&ldquo;They think we&rsquo;ve gone on ahead. Suppose we fool
them and camp right here after they leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s face lighted up and Sandy was jubilant at
the chance to rest his weary legs. A few minutes
later, hidden in the bushes, they watched Govereau
and his four men string out on the trail and quietly
disappear into the forest. They got a close look at
the leader of the band as he passed, and Dick and
Sandy could not suppress a shiver of dread. The
man had an exceedingly evil and cruel face.</p>
<p>Dick hid his disappointment in learning nothing
of Henderson&rsquo;s movements and of Sandy&rsquo;s uncle in
his elation at this opportunity to camp where Toma
had planned. They would be fresh for a long hike
next day, which would take them to the hidden cache
of provisions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Toma said little while they prepared their scanty
meal, which was for the most part, bear steak.
Every now and then the guide looked up at the sky
and sniffed the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storm pretty soon. Winter come. Heap big
blizzard few days,&rdquo; he finally confided to Dick and
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means we&rsquo;ve got to make a raise of a dog
team,&rdquo; Dick said, tearing off a huge hunk of cold
bear meat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing Mr. MacLean gave you that money,&rdquo;
Sandy observed.</p>
<p>Dick agreed with his chum, stifling a yawn. Already
his eyes were closing. Toma consented to take
the first watch, and in a few moments Dick and
Sandy were sound asleep in their blankets.</p>
<p>The night passed without incident, Dick and
Sandy taking their turns on watch. At dawn they
were on the trail again, leaving camp hungry. They
hesitated to shoot at any small game for fear Govereau&rsquo;s
men might be near. Toward noon, however,
Dick&rsquo;s gnawing stomach got the better of his caution,
and he knocked over a partridge. They made
a short stop, broiled the partridge and divided it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Appetites a little appeased, they were off again,
hoping to make the cache of provisions on Limping
Dog Creek by nightfall. Late in the afternoon they
trudged down into the canyon designated by MacLean
on the map.</p>
<p>It was twilight when the canyon walls widened
and grew less precipitous. Toma said they were
nearing Limping Dog Creek. Sandy was hobbling
from a slight sprain received when he tripped over
a root, and Dick was far from fresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flapjacks will sure taste good,&rdquo; Dick murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; Sandy groaned in answer.</p>
<p>When at last they came in sight of the creek,
Toma stopped to compare landmarks with the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There um three trees,&rdquo; Toma pointed to some
huge balmagiliad trees that stood out from the smaller
jack pines like giants.</p>
<p>They hurried forward. Martin MacLean had
said the cache was in the third of the three big trees
nearest the creek. They speedily reached the tree
and Toma climbed it. He was gone for some time,
Dick and Sandy straining their eyes upward through
the dark foliage.</p>
<p>Toma came down much slower than he had gone
up. As he dropped to the turf, Dick and Sandy
awaited anxiously his report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him gone,&rdquo; said Toma briefly. &ldquo;Cache not
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, and Sandy&rsquo;s countenance
grew glum indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this isn&rsquo;t the tree,&rdquo; Dick ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him right tree,&rdquo; Toma was certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been Govereau&rsquo;s men,&rdquo; Dick spoke,
after a short silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe so,&rdquo; Toma grunted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">DICK DROPS A MOOSE</span></h2>
<p>The loss of the cache, more than anything else,
had cast its shadow of gloom over the spirits of Dick
and Sandy. Toma, however, who had made the discovery,
seemed not so deeply concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We catch um meat,&rdquo; Toma attempted to cheer
the boys. &ldquo;Mebbe bye an&rsquo; bye we eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that,&rdquo; declared Sandy,
thinking of the lonely strip of bacon and the one
handful of flour, which were all that remained of
the provisions the grizzly had destroyed. &ldquo;To tell
you the truth, I haven&rsquo;t seen very much game lately.
Have you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick shook his head, forced to acknowledge the
truth of Sandy&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a fellow&rsquo;s hungry,&rdquo; Sandy complained,
rubbing his lame ankle, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s hungry, that&rsquo;s all, and
a mouthful of bacon is about as much good to him
as a drop of fresh water in the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me no eat one time for whole week.&rdquo; Toma reminded
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Both boys looked up in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole week!&rdquo; gasped Dick, &ldquo;great guns! I
hope we don&rsquo;t come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe set snare for rabbit tonight,&rdquo; encouraged
Toma. &ldquo;Toma good ketch um rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could eat two or three rabbits,&rdquo; Sandy grumbled,
taking up the slack in his belt.</p>
<p>As they made their way onward, Dick seriously
considered their plight. Thoughts of the ruthless,
cold-hearted rifling of the cache by Bear Henderson&rsquo;s
men filled him with an anger that was difficult
to suppress. But anger or resentment could not help
them now. The thing to do was to abandon any
attempt at further progress that day and put in a few
good hours hunting while it was yet daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better pitch camp here
for a while, until we can bag some game. My suggestion
is that each of us start off in a different
direction. We must keep track of the time and be
sure to get back to camp by dark. The chances are
that at least one of us will be successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hunt or starve,&rdquo; agreed Sandy. &ldquo;Which way
do you want me to go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Toma had better try his luck here in the creek
valley,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;because game is apt to be more
plentiful here and he&rsquo;s the best hunter. You and I
can make our way into the hills, keeping about half
a mile apart. Shoot anything at all that has meat
on its bones,&rdquo; and he winked slyly at Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could eat a skunk and like it,&rdquo; groaned Sandy.
&ldquo;By the way, before we start don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d
better divide that bacon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a queer, inexplicable feeling, Dick produced
the last morsels of food from their packs and divided
them carefully. If he gave Sandy a little more than
an equal portion, no one, with the possible exception
of a tiny sparrow perched on a branch overhead,
could have noticed it. They ate in silence, and in
silence they arose immediately after their inadequate
meal and started off for the hunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever see anything,&rdquo; Dick muttered
to himself, &ldquo;or if I do the chances are that the
pesky thing will get away. Hang it all, why did
Govereau, or whoever it was, have to find that
cache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s mood brightened a few minutes later as he
came up through the autumn sunshine to the foot
of a slope, thickly covered with stunted pine. It
looked like a very good hiding place for ptarmigan,
or possibly even deer. He unslung his rifle and
went forward as cautiously as he could, one finger
hovering close to the trigger of his gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>But, after an hour&rsquo;s slow progress, Dick had begun
to lose hope. He had seen nothing. Apparently
the forest was as devoid of all animal life as a
city street. Except for a hawk, circling lazily about
high overhead, there was neither bird nor beast anywhere
in that lonely stretch of wilderness.</p>
<p>Mopping his perspiring brow, the young hunter
finally sat down for a moment&rsquo;s rest, before continuing
his course to the top of a high ridge.</p>
<p>Then an abrupt, totally unexpected crackling in
the heavy Saskatoon thicket ahead caused him to
start&mdash;almost in wonderment. His breath came
quickly. He half rose, then fearing, that even his
slightest sound might spoil everything, he sank down
again, his left hand nursing the cold, blue barrel of
his Ross rifle.</p>
<p>More crackling, a sudden parting of the bushes,
and Dick&rsquo;s heart almost stood still. A large bull
moose, majestic in his stature, crashed into view.</p>
<p>By this time Dick was fairly trembling with excitement.
Twice he endeavored to raise his rifle to
his shoulder. His arm shook so much that he knew
it would be worse than useless to attempt a shot
while his nerves were in such a condition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; thought Dick, then across his mind
flashed the mental picture of a cache, broken into and
robbed, and the sneering face of Pierre Govereau
mocking him. Then his rifle went to his shoulder,
and two loud reports rang out in quick succession.
The moose stumbled, but did not fall. Dick heard
quite plainly its sudden snort of alarm and the crash
of underbrush as it struck off at terrific speed directly
down the slope in the direction from which he
had but recently come.</p>
<p>The moose was wounded, he knew, but he also was
well aware from previous experience that a wounded
moose will often travel for miles before it falls.
Galvanized into action, Dick was off, following the
blood-stained trail, hoping against hope that either
Sandy or Toma might intercept the animal before
it had become lost in the intricate tangle of brush and
woodland that lay to the south.</p>
<p>Sliding down a particularly treacherous part of
the trail, Dick&rsquo;s foot caught in an exposed root and
he fell heavily. As he bounded to his feet again, he
thought he heard a distant shout&mdash;but he was not
entirely sure.</p>
<p>For twenty minutes more, he pushed forward rapidly,
sometimes almost losing the trail of the moose.
Then finally he did lose it altogether. Search as he
would, the telltale tracks had disappeared as magically
and as unaccountably as if the animal had leaped
into the air and flown away to a place of safety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most unusual thing I ever heard of,&rdquo;
Dick commented aloud, racing about in a vain effort
to discover some sign that would point out again the
trail that had so suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>In despair his eyes fell upon a level formation of
rock not more than thirty feet away. Could it be
that the moose had passed that way&mdash;scrambled over
the level rock floor in its mad race with death? If
so, it would explain the mysterious disappearance of
the tracks; but there must be blood-stains somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop-ee!&rdquo; he shouted as his quick eyes made
out the signs he sought&mdash;small splotches of red scattered
across the smooth surface of sandstone. And
shortly thereafter, he hurried on again, like a young
bloodhound finding fresh scent along the path ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more careful next time,&rdquo; he assured himself.
&ldquo;It would be a pity if this moose got away.
I&rsquo;d have been ashamed to show my face in camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two miles further on he almost forgot about the
moose. Through a screen of willows, skirting a
small creek, he caught the faint movement of some
living thing&mdash;something that stood concealed and
which watched him furtively as he made his way
along through the dead and matted grass of the little
valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Dick felt instinctively that some danger threatened.
What this was he had no way of finding out,
yet the feeling persisted that he was being watched,
spied upon by an enemy more terrible than any wild
denizen of the forest. As he advanced swiftly on
his way, he was conscious of a strange tingling of
nerves, as if he half expected at any moment to be
pounced upon and overcome by an unknown assailant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt so queer about anything in my
life,&rdquo; he confided to the silent trees, as he hurried
quickly along. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that I saw something
move there in the bushes, and I&rsquo;m positive that it
wasn&rsquo;t an animal that walks on four legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then, an object lying on the ground, immediately
ahead, drove every other thought from his
mind. With a glad cry he sprang forward, and, a
short time later, stood looking down at the prostrate
body of the bull moose, majestic even in death.</p>
<p>A lump arose in Dick&rsquo;s throat as he stood there
silently regarding it. &ldquo;Poor old fellow,&rdquo; he breathed,
&ldquo;it was a shame to do this. But perhaps you saved
us from starving. Maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shout close at hand roused Dick from his musings.
Wheeling about his eyes lighted with pride
and happiness, as he espied the approaching figures
of Sandy and Toma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; Sandy exclaimed, as he strode
up to where his chum was standing. &ldquo;I just knew
you&rsquo;d do it. Say, I believe it&rsquo;s the biggest moose I
ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ketch um big fella,&rdquo; complimented Toma.
&ldquo;It is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together the three young adventurers stood admiring
the moose. So interested had they become
that not one of them caught the sound of stealthy
footsteps until a heavy, threatening form, followed
by three others, pushed its way within the circle of
admiring eyes.</p>
<p>With a cry of warning, Dick sprang back, clutching
his rifle tightly. Then he looked at the man.</p>
<p>It was Pierre Govereau!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">PIERRE GOVEREAU</span></h2>
<p>Govereau advanced menacingly. Backed by the
rifles of the three villainous looking men with him,
the three boys could do nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you do wiz my moose?&rdquo; Govereau snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you shot that moose!&rdquo; Dick
exclaimed angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It iss so,&rdquo; Govereau avowed brazenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed hotly. &ldquo;I shot that
moose. I can prove it. What do you mean by
holding us up this way. We have done you no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It iss Henderson bizness&mdash;zat.&rdquo; Govereau
turned and signaled his men to bind the three young
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sweat for this,&rdquo; Dick gritted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so much as you,&rdquo; Govereau taunted. &ldquo;Young
fellas like you should stay home wiz zee mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Dick gritted his teeth again, but resolved to keep
his mouth shut. He must save his breath to get
Sandy and Toma out of the mess. It must have
been Govereau&rsquo;s men watching him when he had felt
so queer on the trail of the wounded moose.</p>
<p>Dick did not resist the moose-hide thongs as they
were bound mercilessly tight about his wrists.
Sandy and Toma followed his example. There were
other ways of getting the better of Govereau, and
it might be easier if they submitted, or seemed to
submit, mildly to capture.</p>
<p>They could see one of the men slicing steaks from
the moose haunch before, at a guttural command,
they were started off into the woods, northward
along Limping Dog Creek.</p>
<p>An hour&rsquo;s tramping brought them to Govereau&rsquo;s
camp, four miles up the creek. The scar faced Indian
was there to greet them. He leered at the captives
hatefully. Dick felt that the Indian knew one
of them had shot him at the camp forty miles away,
and that the savage would do anything in his power
to wreak vengeance.</p>
<p>Govereau had made his headquarters in an old
cabin, deserted by some trapper. There were two
rooms, and the three young captives were shoved
into the smaller of them, their hands still bound behind
them. Probably their captors realized they
would soon untie themselves, but since with the huge
oaken bolt shot on the door, there was no way of
getting out of the room, they did not bother themselves
about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Dick turned to Toma and Sandy, when
at last they were left alone.</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s face was as stolid as ever. Sandy had
nothing to say. He sat down on the bunk at one
side of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re in a pickle, all right,&rdquo; Sandy said
at last.</p>
<p>Dick paced back and forth twice, then stopped
before the door, which he carefully inspected. The
door seemed heavy enough to repel the attack of a
battering ram, say nothing of three boys. Dick
turned back to Sandy and Toma. &ldquo;Govereau will
question us now, I suppose,&rdquo; Dick spoke rapidly.
&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll probably take us out separately to see
if our stories are the same. He&rsquo;ll want to know
just how much we know of Henderson&rsquo;s movements
and what we are trying to do against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we say?&rdquo; Sandy scratched his head.
Toma said nothing. The young Indian seemed to
feel that the situation was beyond his ability to
handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell Govereau that we have been visiting
the factor at Fort du Lac&mdash;spending our vacation
there, and that we were on our way south&mdash;to return
home. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds all right,&rdquo; Sandy responded, a little
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No go so far east if go south from Fort du
Lac,&rdquo; Toma&rsquo;s dark eyes blinked rapidly.</p>
<p>Dick thought a minute. &ldquo;Then suppose we have
some one at Fort Dunwoody that we want to see
before we leave for home&mdash;a cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trick,&rdquo; Sandy agreed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we all understand what we&rsquo;re to tell,&rdquo; Dick
resumed. &ldquo;Toma, how about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell um,&rdquo; was the taciturn reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Govereau believes our story he may let us
go,&rdquo; Dick concluded. &ldquo;If he learns the truth he
may do something worse than just hold us behind
a locked door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three were silent for a time while Dick paced
back and forth. Upon his shoulders he realized
was now the bulk of responsibility. Toma might
excel him on the trail, where native woodcraft and
instinctive stealth was the chief requirement, but in
the present situation Toma was at best only a willing
servant. And it was Sandy&rsquo;s nature to depend upon
his chum, himself only offering what suggestions
occurred to his lower mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a plan to escape, if this first scheme fails!&rdquo;
Dick suddenly stopped his pacing and looked about
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Sandy jumped as if shot, so sudden was Dick&rsquo;s
exclamation. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it,&rdquo; the young Scotch lad
cried eagerly. Toma brightened.</p>
<p>Dick turned to Toma. &ldquo;Sandy or I would be glad
to do this,&rdquo; he addressed the young guide, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
just about impossible for us. Can I depend on
your support, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do my best; what you say I do?&rdquo; Toma promised
sincerely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plan is this: when Govereau questions you,
Toma, you are to express a desire to join him&mdash;to
turn against us. See? With you on the outside
there&rsquo;s much more chance of escaping than with all
three of us in here. Can you do it, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll leave everything to you once you get
outside. Of course, Govereau may get wise to what
you are up to. But, again, he&rsquo;s no doubt pretty
anxious to get more men in his band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Dick concluded his instructions, there came
a noise at the door, and the bolt was shot back. A
sharp, rat-like face, that of a half-breed, was pushed
in. &ldquo;You come,&rdquo; said the man, indicating Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Dick and Sandy both realized that a crisis was at
hand. If they revealed their real mission to Govereau
they would without doubt never reach the
mounted police. Perhaps they would not reach them
anyway, yet there was a good chance that Govereau
might let them go if they convinced him of their
ignorance of any of Henderson&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, Dick,&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s voice was a little
husky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, old boy, I&rsquo;ll make out,&rdquo; Dick
cheered him.</p>
<p>Toma was visibly affected, and Dick reassured
him also. Short as the time had been that Toma
had been with them, there seemed already a strong
bond of friendship between the young Indian and
the two young adventurers.</p>
<p>Dick squared his shoulders and followed the rat-faced
half-breed into the other room. Dick now
faced Pierre Govereau. The Frenchman was seated
at a board table across from the door which just
had been closed after Dick. At one side of the room
a huge fireplace roared and crackled. The rat-faced
half-breed went over and squatted before the fire,
picking up a red-hot iron in a pair of tongs. Dick
Kent shivered as he saw what the man was doing.
But he met Govereau&rsquo;s eyes unflinchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What iss zee bizness you bean on when you
make for zee Fort Dunwoody?&rdquo; Govereau came
straight to the point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;My friend and I are visiting in Canada,&rdquo; replied
Dick cooly. &ldquo;The factor at Fort du Lac was an
old friend of my chum&rsquo;s father. I have a cousin
in Fort Dunwoody that we wanted to call on before
we went home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I zink you lie,&rdquo; growled Govereau. He sat
silent for a moment, glaring at Dick as if he would
hypnotize the young man with his snake-like eyes.
But Dick&rsquo;s gaze did not falter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you fear my men?&rdquo; Govereau&rsquo;s voice
cracked like a whip.</p>
<p>Dick hesitated a moment. Sandy&rsquo;s uncle&rsquo;s welfare
might depend upon his misleading the villainous
Govereau. &ldquo;We had been told there were bandits
along the trail to the fort,&rdquo; Dick replied in a clear
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw!&rdquo; scoffed Henderson&rsquo;s lieutenant, and
wheeled to the half-breed at the fireplace. &ldquo;Napio,
zee iron now. We make zee young upstart talk
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick recoiled slightly as the Indian arose and
came forward with a short piece of iron, red hot
and smoking in the tongs. Govereau came out from
behind the table. Dick&rsquo;s hands were still tied behind
him. The Frenchman seized Dick in an iron grasp
and tore away his shirt front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell zee truth now,&rdquo; Govereau hissed.
&ldquo;Queeck, Napio!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The iron was pushed close to Dick&rsquo;s naked breast.
He could feel the heat of it already searing his skin.</p>
<p>Then the door opened and the half-breed hesitated.
Govereau turned, snarling at the interruption. An
Indian stood in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men all go way,&rdquo; said the intruder. &ldquo;They
drink firewater. M&rsquo;sieu Govereau, you come bring
them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw him back in. We finish wiz him tonight,&rdquo;
Govereau ordered the half-breed. &ldquo;Bring zee young
white one. I come soon,&rdquo; he waved away the Indian
at the door.</p>
<p>Dick reeled into Sandy&rsquo;s arms a minute later as
he was roughly pushed into the back room. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
call you next, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick gasped a little weakly.
&ldquo;If he asks you why you feared his men, say you
thought they were bandits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy pressed Dick&rsquo;s arm to signify he understood
and followed the rat-faced half-breed out into
the front room. Dick and Toma waited only a few
minutes before the door opened and Sandy was
pushed in once more. Govereau had not attempted
to torture Sandy. He seemed in a hurry to go after
his men. They could hear him cursing through even
those thick, log walls, for Sandy&rsquo;s story had tallied
with Dick&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>It was Toma&rsquo;s turn next, and Dick talked earnestly
with the guide as to the method he was to
use in convincing Govereau of his desires to be a
traitor to his white friends. Dick was now certain
that Govereau would not believe their story. Toma
was their last chance.</p>
<p>They waited for some time before Toma was
called. Then the half-breed came again, and beckoned
to the guide. In high suspense Dick and Sandy
watched him disappear through the door.</p>
<p>In a half hour they took courage. Toma had
not come back. They waited an hour and still Toma
was not thrown back among them. Their spirits
rose. Toma had then convinced Govereau of his
sincerity.</p>
<p>It was growing dark now, and at any moment
Dick expected Govereau to call for him again. The
Frenchman seemed to have a personal enmity for
Dick, perhaps because of the young man&rsquo;s refusal
to be cowed by browbeating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if Toma really does turn traitor?&rdquo; Sandy
broke a long silence. &ldquo;I heard Uncle Walter say
these Indians couldn&rsquo;t be trusted too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why, but I trust Toma absolutely,&rdquo;
Dick replied confidently, &ldquo;that Indian is smarter than
we think. If Govereau really is convinced that
Toma is going in with him we&rsquo;ll soon be out of here.
When I think what your uncle may be going through
up there, I can&rsquo;t sit still.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he couldn&rsquo;t get much worse than we have
already,&rdquo; Sandy returned grimly. &ldquo;Gee, I never
thought we&rsquo;d come to this when we left Fort
du Lac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could stand it better if I wasn&rsquo;t so hungry and
thirsty,&rdquo; Dick declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said it,&rdquo; Sandy heartily sanctioned. &ldquo;I
guess they&rsquo;re going to starve us too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you notice it&rsquo;s growing colder?&rdquo; Dick asked
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe it was because we didn&rsquo;t have
any fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember Toma said we were due for a blizzard,&rdquo;
Dick recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny why Govereau doesn&rsquo;t call one of us out
again,&rdquo; Sandy mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s after his men I expect. An Indian reported
they were drinking while I was being questioned.
The fellow saved me from being tortured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Engaging in a wandering conversation, Dick and
Sandy whiled away two more long hours, in which
they managed to untie each other&rsquo;s wrists, and kept
warm by walking back and forth and swinging
their arms. They were almost certain now that
Govereau had gone. If so, then if Toma hadn&rsquo;t
been forced to go with the Frenchman, he would
be more able to help them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>It was along toward morning when Dick started
up out of a doze to hear the sound of a blow and
the muffled fall of a body in the front room. There
was a sharp stifled cry. Then Dick shook Sandy to
wakefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; whispered Sandy, leaping to his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-s-sh,&rdquo; Dick cautioned.</p>
<p>Through the darkness in the room they could hear
the heavy wooden bolt on the door of their prison
sliding backward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">TOMA AND A COLD SNAP</span></h2>
<p>With bated breath Dick and Sandy awaited some
sign of the identity of the person who was entering
so stealthily. Was it the scar faced Indian coming
for vengeance, or was it&mdash;the warmth from the
other room was rushing in. It was Toma&rsquo;s voice
that came to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Come! Govereau gone long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearts leaping with joy, Dick and Sandy joined
the young guide in the darkness. He led them out
into the larger room, picking his way with a certainty
that revealed he could see in the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch for one fella on floor. I hit him on head
with rifle,&rdquo; Toma whispered. &ldquo;Govereau&rsquo;s men all
go to post ten miles south where they drink fire-water.
Govereau heap mad. Him after them. They
come back anytime. He take me long with um. I
run away. He know what I do now. You bet he
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Toma swung open the cabin door, and Dick and
Sandy followed him out. It was so cold their teeth
commenced chattering almost immediately. They
buttoned up their jackets and hurried off into the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make Fort Dunwoody yet,&rdquo; Dick shivered,
almost gladly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we will,&rdquo; Sandy came back.</p>
<p>Then they fell silent as they took Toma&rsquo;s tireless,
jogging pace, beneath a cloudy sky. Again the
Indian&rsquo;s trail wisdom came in like a God-send. Dick
and Sandy did not know where they were going,
but they had a feeling that Toma certainly did.</p>
<p>How long they ran they did not know when they
began to feel damp spots on their cheeks and hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing,&rdquo; Dick panted over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; wheezed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to cover our trail,&rdquo; Dick came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so, but I can&rsquo;t talk. I&rsquo;ve got to save
my wind. You must be made of iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick said no more, and presently Toma slowed
down. It was snowing heavily now, and with the
going getting harder underfoot, Dick and Sandy
were grateful for the slackening of the pace. Yet
they sensed something unusual ahead had been the
cause of it, and were not perfectly at ease by any
means.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Finally Toma came to a dead stop at the edge
of a clearing. Peering ahead through the gloom
and the falling snow, they could see the lights of a
cabin twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stay here; I go on,&rdquo; Toma instructed in a
low voice. &ldquo;My brother live here. Him give us
warm clothes. I see if all right first. Wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy hovered in the undergrowth and
watched Toma&rsquo;s figure melt away into the gloom
in the direction of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he gets some clothes for us,&rdquo; Sandy chattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad Govereau didn&rsquo;t take my wallet,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;We can pay for what we get now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Frenchman didn&rsquo;t think we had any money,
I suppose,&rdquo; Sandy opined.</p>
<p>They fell silent then, for against the lighted
window they could see a head silhouetted through
the falling snow. Toma was peering in at the
window. For an instant the guide&rsquo;s head was outlined
there, then it disappeared. Presently a shaft
of light shot out over the snow as the door opened
and closed. A moment later the door opened again,
though the boys could not see who entered.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy expected Toma to come back for
them almost immediately, or at least signal that all
was right. But the minutes passed and the guide
did not return nor make a sign. The boys began
to worry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose is keeping him?&rdquo; Dick
wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Sandy replied, &ldquo;but I do know
I can&rsquo;t stand still in this cold much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll circle around the cabin and come in closer,&rdquo;
Dick directed. &ldquo;If something has happened we
want to be sure we don&rsquo;t get into trouble, too.
Toma&rsquo;s brother may have been killed by Henderson&rsquo;s
men. The country seems to be alive with the
villains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently they started around the cabin. Half way
around, Dick stumbled and fell over something in
the snow. Sandy stopped dead and a gasp of horror
came from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fallen over a
dead man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick got up, more shaken by the identity of the
thing he had fallen over than by the fall.</p>
<p>Covered by the light film of snow that had fallen,
and which was steadily growing heavier, was the
body of a man. In the gloom they could not distinguish
his features, but they were put on their
guard. Armed only with their hunting knives, they
felt that the utmost caution must be exercised in
further advances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma&rsquo;s in trouble. I know it now!&rdquo; Dick
ejaculated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s up to us to get him out,&rdquo; Sandy
retorted.</p>
<p>Drawing their knives they started stealthily for
the cabin. They could hear no sound of life, and
the knowledge of what was lying behind them under
the snow made the atmosphere doubly fearsome.</p>
<p>At last they reached the single window through
which they had seen Toma look into the cabin. Dick
cautiously raised his eyes over the sill. He looked
only an instant, then he quickly ducked downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the scar faced Indian!&rdquo; he made the astounding
disclosure to Sandy. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another with
him. They have Toma bound. He&rsquo;s lying on the
bunk. I could see his eyes. They&rsquo;re playing cards
and talking. How in the world did they ever catch
Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Indian again,&rdquo; muttered Sandy. &ldquo;How the
deuce did he get here anyway. We saw him last at
Govereau&rsquo;s camp. It&rsquo;s ghostly the way that fellow
shows up everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Govereau must have sent him here on some dirty
business,&rdquo; Dick decided. &ldquo;Perhaps Toma&rsquo;s brother
had valuable furs stored here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">With mutual consent they crawled away from the
cabin and hid in the trees at the edge of the clearing,
where they tried to decide on a plan by which
to rescue Toma. That they had a good chance of
success they were sure. The scar-faced Indian had
the use of but one arm since the wound Toma had
given him, so they had but one real man to deal
with. Still they were as well as unarmed. What
could they do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; Dick was speaking fast.
&ldquo;You go out into the woods and begin calling for
help, anything to get one of them out of the cabin.
Then I&rsquo;ll slip in and see if I can&rsquo;t take care of the
other one and get hold of a rifle. The Indian will
probably stay inside, and wounded as he is I&rsquo;m sure
I can handle him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! That&rsquo;s a ghostly job you have for me to
do,&rdquo; Sandy whispered ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do it, Sandy,&rdquo; urged Dick. &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t hurt to try. You keep hidden, and when
one of them comes out to see what&rsquo;s wrong, keep
quiet. I&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy gripped hands, then parted. Dick
crept around to a point opposite the door of the
cabin, waiting tensely until Sandy began his part
of the ruse. He did not have to wait long. Presently,
from afar in the forest, a shriek as of some
one in mortal agony, arose. Sandy was doing well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-e-l-p, oh, h-e-l-p,&rdquo; his voice rang out, high and
shrill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Sandy repeated his call several times, then the
cabin door opened, and as Dick had hoped, the scar
faced Indian&rsquo;s companion came out. He had a rifle
in his hands.</p>
<p>Again Sandy&rsquo;s cry rang out from a little further
off. The man hesitated no longer, but stepped from
the cabin door and walked across the clearing into
the trees to investigate. He disappeared in the
direction of Sandy&rsquo;s unearthly wailing.</p>
<p>Dick ran forward across the clearing, his moccasins
making no noise in the snow. He remembered
that the scar faced Indian had been sitting at the
table facing the window. Therefore, if he had not
changed his position, his back would be to the door.</p>
<p>Pausing before the door, Dick found it open a
crack. Cautiously he pushed it open a little more
and peered in. The Indian still was sitting with his
back to the door. He was idly shuffling the cards.
Against the bunk where Toma lay bound, Dick
could see a rifle leaning. One leap across the floor
and he would have this rifle. It was a desperate
chance, but he must make the best of it.</p>
<p>Swift as a panther, Dick threw open the door
and leaped in. The astonished Indian was scarcely
half out of his chair when Dick had the rifle in his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Whether the Indian understood English or not,
Dick did not know, but his words had the required
effect. Slowly the scar-faced Indian turned his ugly
face upon his captor, his mouth twisted into an evil,
smirking grin. Dick stepped forward and drew the
revolver from his captive&rsquo;s belt and tossed it into
a corner. Then he backed toward the bunk with the
rifle still trained on the Indian. Quickly, he drew
his knife and slashed Toma&rsquo;s bonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Now we got um!&rdquo; Toma tore the gag from
his mouth, leaned up and picked up the revolver
Dick had thrown away. In a trice, then, Toma had
lashed the scar-faced Indian to his chair.</p>
<p>Dick already was expecting the return of the
Indian&rsquo;s companion. With the Indian secured, both
Toma and he turned their attention to the door.
With bated breath they waited and listened for
approaching footfalls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">SLUSH ICE</span></h2>
<p>Toma and Dick no longer could hear Sandy hallooing,
and Dick judged that his chum was safely
in hiding. Yet, as they waited, guns trained on the
door, a rifle shot shattered the silence. It came
from the direction taken by the man who had gone
to investigate the calls for help. Dick&rsquo;s face paled.
What did it mean? Had poor Sandy fallen? Had
the man found him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out,&rdquo; Dick said tensely to Toma a
moment later.</p>
<p>Whatever Toma&rsquo;s reply was Dick did not hear
it, for with an impatient leap he flung open the
door and disappeared. Toma remained behind, not
sure that his young white friend&rsquo;s move had been
wise, yet believing he could do more to help if he
stayed in the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>When Dick left the cabin he made straight for
the point from which he thought the rifle shot had
come. It was growing lighter. In the east a faint
gray fan of light showed over the forest&mdash;dawn.
He ran on for a little way, then he came upon tracks.
Pursuing these at a run, he came in sight of the
man who had left the cabin an hour before. The
meeting was a surprise for both.</p>
<p>Dick dodged behind a tree as the other fired from
his hip. The ball whizzed harmlessly over Dick&rsquo;s
head, and he shot hastily. His shot also went wild,
but the other took to his heels. Dick did not pursue
him, but began calling for Sandy. Presently he was
rewarded by a distant shout and in a few minutes
the chums were reunited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he shoot at you?&rdquo; Dick queried anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know what he shot at. Maybe he
thought it was me,&rdquo; Sandy replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half
frozen. Gosh, it seemed hours out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry back to the cabin,&rdquo; Dick hastened.
&ldquo;Toma is there, and we&rsquo;ve captured the scar faced
Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy was too cold to care how many Indians
had been captured, and he hobbled along after Dick
like a stiff, old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Toma is all right,&rdquo; Dick said anxiously
as they neared the cabin.</p>
<p>On the threshold of the cabin they stood a moment
later in stark amazement. Toma lay bleeding and
silent on the floor, and the scar faced Indian was
gone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that doesn&rsquo;t beat anything!&rdquo; Dick ejaculated,
rushing to Toma.</p>
<p>The young guide came to at the application of a
little water. His head had been struck with something;
an overturned chair revealed what the escaped
Indian had probably used.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He slip out ropes some way,&rdquo; Toma explained
when he could sit up once more. &ldquo;I watch door
when him jump on me. That all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re alive&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I can say,&rdquo; Dick
said thankfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Sandy hurried from the fireplace
where he had been warming himself to the
crude wooden table. A slip of paper with writing
on it lay among the scattered playing cards. Dick
also hastened forward and read the roughly scrawled
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pierre Govereau:</p>
<p>Send Many-Scar Jackson and Swede
to Big John Toma&rsquo;s cabin. We want the
black fox fur he has hidden there.</p>
<p><span class="jr">BEAR HENDERSON.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dick and Sandy read it aloud to Toma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;This my big brother&rsquo;s cabin,&rdquo; Toma explained
simply. &ldquo;Last night I see no one when look in
window. I go in. That Many-Scar and other fella
come in, ketch me. I not know where Big John is.
They not find um black fox. Big John sell um
black fox t&rsquo;ree weeks go by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy dropped their eyes. They now
felt sure who the man was that Dick had fallen
over&mdash;the dead man. How could they tell Toma?
At last Dick took the guide&rsquo;s arm. Silently they
went out, Sandy following.</p>
<p>Toma showed no emotion as they showed him the
body partly covered with snow. He might have
been a wooden image as he said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him Big John Toma; I know before I see. I
feel he dead. That Many-Scar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; something
choked off his voice. His dark eyes suddenly flashed
and glowed like coals of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give ten cents for Many-Scar&rsquo;s life,
slick as that Indian is,&rdquo; Sandy whispered.</p>
<p>Dick nodded.</p>
<p>Though all felt they had no time to lose, since
Govereau&rsquo;s men might be expected to follow them,
they could not leave Toma&rsquo;s brother without burial.</p>
<p>All three set to work under the spruce trees, hacking
through the frozen soil with axes. In a half
hour they had dug a shallow grave. Wrapped in
blankets, they gently lowered the body of Big John
Toma to its last resting place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Dick fashioned a rude cross from two saplings,
which he showed to Toma. The young Indian
nodded. &ldquo;Good; him Christian&mdash;me too,&rdquo; said the
guide.</p>
<p>When they had placed the last sod on the mound,
Dick and Sandy left their friend alone by the grave
and went to the cabin to prepare for continuing their
journey. They found much pemmican and dried
fish, upon which Big John Toma had existed, but
nowhere any flour or coffee. By the time they had
arranged shoulder packs and had donned whatever
warm clothes they had found, Toma had joined
them. He seemed his old self once more, though
Dick and Sandy knew that behind his mask of indifference
was deep sorrow and a mighty resolve for the
redskin&rsquo;s revenge upon the murderer of his brother.
The guide refused to take the money Dick offered
him for the food and clothing they had taken from
Big John&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We three days from Fort Dunwoody now,&rdquo;
Toma told them when they were ready for the trail.
&ldquo;Not sure we make um three days. Big blizzard
come pretty soon now. Mebbe tomorrow. We get
um dog sled then. Need um bad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>All that day Toma led them due southeast, across
higher ground, where vegetation was sparse. They
crossed one shallow valley where there were no trees
at all, and upon a ridge at the other side made camp.
It was an advantageous spot from which to watch
the back trail, and before they started on they were
disturbed by the sight of three tiny figures. The
men were undoubtedly on their trail. Straight
across the valley they toiled and they were coming
fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s Govereau!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it looks as if we were only about three
miles ahead of him,&rdquo; Sandy declared. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
a move on. I don&rsquo;t want to get mixed up with him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; Dick heartily agreed.</p>
<p>Toma was of the same mind, and they all set off
at a fast pace when once more they took to the trail.
They felt confident they could lengthen the lead on
their pursuers, but two hours after noon, when they
paused to rest on a high ridge, they looked back and
were astounded to see the three men not more than
a mile behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them best trail men Govereau got,&rdquo; Toma protected
his own prowess on finding that he had been
outpaced.</p>
<p>They started on again, doubling their former
speed. A half hour more brought them to the banks
of a river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Him Saskatoon River,&rdquo; Toma told them. &ldquo;Him
full slush ice. We make um raft in hurry; get
over, then we safe from Govereau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy looked off across the sullen
expanse of the Saskatoon. As Toma had said, it
was filled with a slow-moving mass of slush, formed
by night freezes and day thaws.</p>
<p>They fell to work like Trojans on a raft, lashing
dead logs together with tiny saplings and tough
vines. It was a cumbersome raft that they at last
shoved out into the icy stream. With poles to propel
the unwieldy craft, they began the perilous trip
across the river. The delay caused by the building
of the raft had given their pursuers time to overtake
them, and at any moment they expected to hear a
shout or rifle shots from the shore they were slowly
leaving behind.</p>
<p>One side of the raft was heavier than the other,
and out in the current they came near being spilled
off, before they followed Toma&rsquo;s example and balanced
the logs by shifting their weight from side
to side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Pushing on desperately, they reached midstream,
when their pursuers reached the river. But the few
shots that were fired fell short. The boys had poled
the raft out of range. Waving their hands to the
chagrined men they reached the other shore and,
abandoning their raft, hastened on.</p>
<p>Once more snow was spitting out of the gray
heavens, and it was growing steadily colder. They
hiked for three miles, then Toma advised a halt
The guide began immediately throwing up a shelter
of boughs. Dick and Sandy helped with a will, and
they finished none too soon. With the fall of night
the blizzard Toma had prophesied swept down upon
them like a thousand, shrieking demons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">THE BLIZZARD</span></h2>
<p>When the boys awoke on the following morning,
numb and stiff from cold in spite of the protection
of their crudely constructed shelter, a full six inches
of snow covered the surface of their blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow make um much warmer to sleep,&rdquo; Toma
explained to them, as he crawled out of his bed,
very much as a husky gets out of a snowdrift.</p>
<p>Dick turned his eyes towards the open door of the
shelter and shivered. Contrary to his expectations
the storm had not abated during the night. A shining,
white wall of snow almost shut out any view
of their camp surroundings, while the wind continued
to howl furiously.</p>
<p>To all appearances, the boys were shut in by the
high, white walls of a snow prison. Snow sifted in
the door of their shelter and through the numerous
cracks in the walls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crazy about getting up,&rdquo; Sandy observed,
with a seriousness that brought a laugh from Dick
and Toma. &ldquo;Anyhow, nobody can get anywhere in
a storm like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind, she blow from northwest,&rdquo; Toma cut
in. &ldquo;No get lost when wind blow hard like that.
Keep wind on left side. No like&mdash;but better than
stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young guide counted slowly on his fingers,
and went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me know place where young Indian live. Him
called Raoul Testawich. Got um cabin nice and
warm, an&rsquo; mebbe we ketch um good dog team there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make a try for it.
Sure you won&rsquo;t get lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the guide, with assurance. &ldquo;I find way
all right. Best thing we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhere in the back of Dick&rsquo;s mind there was
some doubt as to the advisability of facing such a
storm, yet he had implicit faith in the prowess of
Toma, and he did not question the young Indian&rsquo;s
ability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be great to get near a warm fireplace again,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;What do you say, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Sandy&rsquo;s answer was to spring up out of his blankets
and commence immediate preparations for
breakfast. A fire was started with considerable
difficulty, and less than an hour later the three boys
were on the trail again, walking Indian file with
Toma in the lead.</p>
<p>But the storm was worse even than they had
anticipated. It was fury unleashed, it sucked the
very breath out of their mouths and blew through
their mackinaws as if they had been cheesecloth.
Dick imagined that the weight of the snow-laden air
alone was sufficient to prevent any long continued
trek across that blinding field of white.</p>
<p>Taking turns breaking trail, they proceeded at a
slow pace, puffing with exertion. And always they
kept the wind on their left, Toma calling out encouragement
from time to time to keep up the spirits
of his less-hardened and less-experienced comrades.</p>
<p>Moisture froze on their coat collars, formed by
the warmth of their breath against the freezing wind.
Breathing became more and more difficult, and
Sandy, the weaker physically of the three, began
to complain of aching muscles and finally stopped
short, panting heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired out,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;all in. Dick,
I don&rsquo;t believe I can go a step further. Can&rsquo;t we
sit down and rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was on the point of acceding to Sandy&rsquo;s
request, when Toma, several paces in the lead, came
back, crying out his disapproval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; shouted the guide above the howling
of the wind. &ldquo;No do that; get um legs all stiffened
up. Bye an&rsquo; bye can&rsquo;t move. Mebbe we better go
slower, but no sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to go on,&rdquo; declared Sandy bravely, &ldquo;but
you fellows better stop now and then to give me
a chance to breathe. I tell you I&rsquo;m all in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they went on, bracing themselves against
the fury of the wind, shuffling forward through
mounting drifts, in places piled waist high, as if to
block their progress. On several occasions, so violent
was the storm that it was impossible to see anything.
Once, fighting their way through a smothering
fog of white, Toma shouted out a warning.</p>
<p>They were traveling down a sharp incline at the
time, attempting to reach a river bottom, where
towering cliffs would protect them somewhat from
the force of the wind. Toma shouted to them. His
keen ears had detected a sound other than that made
by the blizzard. It was a different sound, and he
had heard it before&mdash;a queer rumbling, followed by a
mighty roar.</p>
<p>With a quickness born of desperation, the guide
seized Dick and Sandy by the arms and pulled them
out of the path of an almost certain death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>As the boys stood trembling and appalled at the
deafening tumult about them, what seemed at first
a vast mountain of snow, went shooting past, carrying
everything before it. The snowslide left in its
wake nothing but a wide belt of barren ground&mdash;even
huge rocks had been torn away from the earth
and hurtled on into the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was close enough to suit me,&rdquo; declared
Sandy in a tragic whisper, as the boys continued
their descent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a snowslide before,
and I don&rsquo;t wish to see another one. Do you feel
shaky, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; admitted Dick, his cheeks slightly
pale. &ldquo;I thought the entire upper part of the valley
wall was falling in on us.&rdquo; He turned to Toma.
&ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;ll be safe
to go down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian lad shook his head thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me no can tell. Mebbe more snowslide after
while. We take chance&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better not go down to the river,&rdquo;
said Dick. &ldquo;It may be a wiser plan to keep up above,
where there isn&rsquo;t the danger from these avalanches.
No use to risk our lives needlessly,&rdquo; he pointed out.</p>
<p>Their guide grunted something under his breath,
then looked up, his sober, dark eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snowslide catch us in the valley,&rdquo; he pronounced.
&ldquo;Big blizzard catch us on top. Which way you like
die best?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>At any other time the two boys would have seen
the humor in the situation, but at that particular
moment neither Sandy nor Dick felt that there was
anything funny about it. For a brief interval they
stood, deep in thought, their two youthful faces
clouded with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference to me which way I die,&rdquo;
declared Sandy at length, kicking disconsolately at
the trunk of a small tree, which had been uprooted
by the force of the snowslide. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re more than
half way down to the river now, so what&rsquo;s the use
of turning back. My choice is the valley. At least,
we can travel faster down there, with more protection
from the storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Dick, &ldquo;I choose the valley,
too. Do you think we can reach your friend Raoul&rsquo;s
place before dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best we can do it take three hours from here,&rdquo;
replied Toma, &ldquo;an&rsquo; night come early. One hour
more mebbe an&rsquo; then we no see at all. Dark all
&rsquo;round. Travel very slow then. Raoul him live
on top of river bank ten, fifteen miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without further word, the three boys made their
way quickly down to the floor of the valley and proceeded
on their way. Beneath their feet was the
frozen course of the Bad Heart River, winding forth
through a white world of weird, irregular cliffs,
now deeply mantled with snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is better,&rdquo; Sandy growled, looking up to
where the storm broke above their heads. &ldquo;I never
would have thought it would make so much difference
being down here. You can actually see a little
and hardly feel the wind at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;But save your breath,
Sandy. You&rsquo;ll need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monotonously, heavily, the moccasined feet of
the three snow-covered figures crunched along the
unbroken trail. In the lead, Toma glided ahead with
an untiring energy that filled Dick with admiration.
He wondered what the young half-breed was thinking
about. Was he, too, secretly fearful of some
new impending danger lurking in their path?</p>
<p>He noticed presently that the shadows, flung
across the floor of the valley, were gradually becoming
darker and darker, a heavy dusk had settled
around them. Toma, barely four feet away, was a
vague, indistinct blur, completely shutting off his
view of the trail in front of him.</p>
<p>That the fury of the blizzard had not abated, was
easily apparent. He could still hear the wind howling
above their heads, and feel the snow as it sifted
quietly down. At every step his feet sunk into the
soft, yielding surface, and his heart pounded like a
trip-hammer from the continuous, never-ending
exertion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther?&rdquo; Sandy demanded, a note of
despair in his voice. &ldquo;How much farther, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy mumbled and complained to himself. He
came stumbling and panting behind Dick, keeping
up an incessant babbling or muttering that filled his
friend with alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
<p>Toma grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A snort of fury seized upon Sandy. With a
strangled, despairing cry, he sprang forward past
Dick and seized Toma by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me you, you&mdash;Indian. I&rsquo;ve got a right
to know how far we&rsquo;ve gone. Come on, now&mdash;out
with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma turned as if to brush off the detaining
hand, when Sandy struck out with all the force of
his right arm. It was an unexpected blow which
sent the young Indian guide staggering to his knees.
Aghast, scarcely believing his senses, Dick stood in
bewilderment for a moment unable to move. With
incredible speed, his companion had sprung forward
again, his fumbling, eager hands encircling Toma&rsquo;s
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; shrieked Dick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>A shrill, unearthly shout, terrible in that utter
desolation, seemed to freeze Dick&rsquo;s blood. Toma
and Sandy were at grips, struggling, rolling&mdash;a
dark, almost indistinguishable ball against the gray
background of billowing drifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; roared Dick again, and, jumping in,
endeavored to separate them. He was still somewhat
dazed over the sudden, unexpected turn events
had taken. What had happened to Sandy? What
was the meaning of that unwarranted attack upon
the kindly young Indian guide? Had the hardship
and severe nervous strain of the past few days,
proved too much for his friend? Desperately he
tugged and pulled at the two combatants, finally
breathing a sigh of thankfulness as Toma rolled on
top, successfully pinning the arms of his assailant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight all gone,&rdquo; declared the victor between
gasps of exhaustion, raising one hand to wipe away
the blood trickling from a cut over his left eye.
&ldquo;Hm, poor fellow go sleep bye an bye. Trail too
much. Worry too much. All make him mad like
grizzly caught in trap, an&rsquo; fight like grizzly till
strength all gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma arose, brushing the snow from his clothing,
then placed a still trembling hand on Dick&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him lay there all night&mdash;huh?&rdquo; he inquired.
&ldquo;What you think we do next? What you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disconsolately, Dick gazed out into the black pall
of darkness which had gathered around them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Toma,&rdquo; he inquired presently, &ldquo;do you believe
Sandy will feel better after a while? Will he be
able to get up and walk again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him walk no more tonight,&rdquo; stated Toma with
conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, there&rsquo;s only one thing to do. I&rsquo;ll
camp here with Sandy while you go on to your
friend&rsquo;s house for help. Do you think you can
make it, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You start &rsquo;em fire here,&rdquo; instructed the Indian.
&ldquo;Me make it all right. Get back two, three hours,
mebbe, with dog team and take poor Sandy to warm
bed. Please no worry if I be little late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dick, gulping down a hard substance
in his throat. &ldquo;Good-bye and good luck to
you, Toma. I&rsquo;ll be here when you return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not a suspicious moisture, but real tears were
standing in Dick&rsquo;s eyes a few minutes later as he and
the young half-breed separated over the recumbent
body of Sandy. A single, warm hand-clasp, then
Toma was away, his footfalls sounding faintly
through the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">DICK SEES A GHOST</span></h2>
<p>Several hours had passed since Toma&rsquo;s departure,
and the fire Dick had kindled had burned down
to a mass of glowing, red embers. The still falling
snow hissed and sputtered over the coals. Off in the
distance a few wolves howled. Sandy lay stretched
out at Dick&rsquo;s feet and the owner of the feet himself
drowsed and nodded in a futile effort to keep awake.</p>
<p>He recovered consciousness a few moments later,
however, when a half-burned stick, lying on the
outer edge of the fire, crackled forth suddenly like
a cap in a toy pistol. In an instant he was wide-eyed
and alert, his eyes straining towards the outer
rim of darkness. He could see nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreaming again,&rdquo; he grumbled to himself, looking
down at Sandy, and wondering how much time
had elapsed since the young Indian guide had set
out on his perilous journey through the storm. Then
his thoughts turned to the happenings of the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>One thing that bothered Dick, and which he had
not yet explained entirely to his own satisfaction,
was Sandy&rsquo;s strange behavior a few hours previous.
The young Scotchman&rsquo;s violent and unwarranted
attack upon Toma was not in the least like the usual
happy-go-lucky conduct that Dick had ascribed to his
friend. Of course, he had heard many times before,
of similar cases where men, driven to the limit of
physical exertion, had acted queerly. It was a sort
of temporary mental breakdown preceding physical
collapse. What Sandy needed was a good sleep,
followed by a day or two of complete rest. He&rsquo;d
probably feel better in the morning.</p>
<p>For the next few minutes Dick busied himself in
gathering more wood for the fire. His first duty
was to keep himself and Sandy warm, as warm as
possible in their hastily improvised camp there in
the inadequate shelter of the river bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma will be back in an hour or two,&rdquo; he
thought to himself, &ldquo;and then everything will be all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down at Sandy, whom he had bundled
up in their two blankets and hoped devoutly that
nothing had happened which might delay the young
Indian&rsquo;s safe return. Although not in the least
doubting the guide&rsquo;s prowess, Dick had learned to
his sorrow that Govereau&rsquo;s opposition was not the
only factor to be considered in the successful carrying
out of their plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is always this blamed wilderness to contend
with,&rdquo; ruminated Dick. &ldquo;Treacherous rivers,
forest fires, wild beasts, the danger of freezing to
death in the extreme cold or getting lost in a blizzard.
Sometimes I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exactly what Dick thought will probably never
be recorded. He woke suddenly from his preoccupation,
a look of fear in his eyes, every nerve tingling
as if tiny electric wires ran close to the surface
of his skin. A slight sound somewhere out there
in the enveloping darkness had caught his attention.
In addition, there had quickly come over him a vague
feeling that he and Sandy were not alone, that an
actual presence, either an animal of some sort or a
human being, had intruded within the circle of their
campfire and was ready to pounce down upon them.</p>
<p>For a brief second Dick could scarcely suppress
the cry of terror that had sprung to his lips. He
wanted to turn his head to look at the thing he knew
to be immediately behind him, but, for some
unknown reason, his body seemed incapable of action.
Instead he sat there, weak and trembling, the blood
pounding in his throat with a force almost suffocating.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>With a truly mighty effort he contrived finally
to twist and squirm around so that his gaze could
discern the thing that menaced him, and in that
instant he caught wildly at the trunk of the up-rooted
tree upon which he sat, so frozen with horror, that
the person who stood immediately opposite&mdash;probably
no more than ten or twelve feet away&mdash;might
easily have advanced and overpowered him without
encountering even the slightest resistance.</p>
<p>In all his life, Dick had never seen so strange an
apparition. His first sickening impression was that
he was confronted not by a man at all but by a real
ghost, fashioned out of a substance as hard and
unyielding as a block of ice. In the glare of the
campfire, the person&rsquo;s body gave forth a peculiar
gleam or sparkle that so amazed and confounded
Dick that he found himself putting up his hands
to his eyes in an effort to shut out the unusual sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma, he tell me come,&rdquo; issued a friendly voice
from the ghost-like figure, standing there in front
of him. &ldquo;You no &rsquo;fraid me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick came to with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he mumbled weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma one mile down river,&rdquo; continued the voice.
&ldquo;Him stuck in ice with huskies. Mebbe no get
sled out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; demanded Dick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
I understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ice thin where river runs quick. Toma, me,
drive on river too close to rapids. Hurry up get
back here for sick fella. We go fast. Toma, me,
sit in sled. All at once ice break. Toma, huskies,
me, sled&mdash;everybody fall in river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick sat and stared incredulously at the speaker.
He understood now. This was Raoul Testawich,
Toma&rsquo;s friend, who, in his broken English, was
trying to describe what had taken place that night
farther up the river. Dick shivered at the thought
of that unexpected, icy-cold plunge when the sled
with its two occupants had broken through into the
river. No wonder that young Testawich looked
like a ghost, his clothing a glistening ice and snow-covered
mantle of white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Toma safe?&rdquo; he questioned eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; nodded the half-breed, &ldquo;Toma all right,
but sled gone. Cut harness away from sled to save
huskies. Toma stay back there now and watch dogs.
What you think; you, me take sick fella along that
far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try,&rdquo; answered Dick in an awed voice.
&ldquo;How far did you say it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About one mile,&rdquo; said Raoul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do it!&rdquo; Dick stated with conviction. &ldquo;I
know we can&mdash;even if we are compelled to drag and
carry him all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>There was admiration and wonder in Dick&rsquo;s eyes
now as he looked at the ice-clad form of the half-breed.
What tremendous endurance Toma and this
man must have. It seemed almost incredible.</p>
<p>He rose quickly, fired with new determination,
walked over to the spot where Sandy lay and, as
gently as possible, attempted to arouse him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up! Wake up, Sandy!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Several minutes elapsed before Dick succeeded in
dragging his friend to an upright position. Sandy
swayed on his feet, mumbling incoherently, glaring
about him with blood-shot, unseeing eyes. Supported
by a friendly arm on either side, he moved
forward, almost a dead weight between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get there sooner you think,&rdquo; encouraged
Raoul. &ldquo;Bye an&rsquo; bye we turn bend in river an&rsquo; then
you see Toma&rsquo;s campfire. Little fella pretty sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They mushed on in silence. Step by step, slowly,
at what seemed to Dick a snail&rsquo;s pace, they plodded
through the darkness towards the place where the
courageous young half-breed guide awaited them.
The snow had ceased to fall. The roar of the storm
above their heads had died down to a faint murmuring.
Presently Raoul spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see light now. Pretty soon we get to campfire.
Then dogs pull sick fella rest of way to my
home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t any sled,&rdquo; interposed Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma tie poles together for sled by time we
get there. Make &rsquo;em pole sled for sick fella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they went on in silence. The light of
Toma&rsquo;s campfire gradually grew brighter as they
advanced. Presently Dick discerned the lonely figure
of the Indian guide and after a time, five blotches
in the snow, five furry forms that snarled and
howled as they waited impatiently for the return of
their master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made it!&rdquo; howled Dick, unable to suppress
his exultation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made it, Toma, old boy.
Yip! Yip!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s answering shout was drowned out by a
deafening chorus from the huskies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">AN UNWELCOME VISITOR</span></h2>
<p>The cabin of Raoul Testawich, which stood in
a sheltering grove of spruce a few miles back from
Bad Heart river, loomed up through the darkness
several hours later as Toma, Raoul and Dick, with
the team of huskies in the lead, crossed a narrow
coulee about thirty yards away from the house and
plunged on through heavy drifts to the narrow,
cleared space immediately in front of the door.</p>
<p>Wrapped in blankets, Sandy still lay on the hastily
improvised sled. As his three comrades gathered
about him, a heavy door squeaked open and a sleepy
voice, in Cree, called out a welcome. In an incredibly
short time they had lifted Sandy from the sled and
had carried him within, gently placing him in a bunk
at one end of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>A young Indian girl, whom Dick judged to be
Raoul&rsquo;s wife or sister, closed the door after them
and advanced swiftly to the mud fireplace where,
over crackling spruce logs, a heavy iron pot sent
forth the pleasant aroma of steaming moose meat.
Close by, with growing interest and enthusiasm,
Dick beheld a small table laden with food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We eat this time for sure,&rdquo; grinned Toma, nudging
Dick&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Mebbe you no want eat now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed the other. &ldquo;There
are two things I want&mdash;food and sleep. I&rsquo;m so
blamed tired that Raoul will have to wait until sometime
tomorrow before I buy his dog team. I believe
I could sleep for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sleep long you like,&rdquo; conceded Toma, as
Raoul left the room to look after the dogs. &ldquo;Him,
Raoul, my very good friend. Fine fella. Like &rsquo;em
sister, too. Mebbe some day marry girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The far away expression in the young half-breed&rsquo;s
eyes drew a laugh from Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I want to
congratulate you. When do you expect to get
married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four&mdash;five&mdash;six years,&rdquo; he answered, counting
laboriously on his fingers. &ldquo;Father Girard he tell
&rsquo;em me at mission too young yet. No marry till
get older. Get older very slow,&rdquo; he concluded, casting
woebegone eyes in the direction of the young
lady of his choice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>The re-entrance of Raoul cut short any further
reference to the subject of Toma&rsquo;s tender affair of
the heart. It was well, too, for the face of the
owner of the huskies wore a look of concern as he
strode forward and commenced to remove his outer
garments, still thickly encrusted with ice and snow.
As he fumbled with the buttons of his moose-hide
coat, he broke forth excitedly in Cree, pausing now
and again to make quick, explanatory gestures with
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; demanded Dick, who
though not understanding one word that had been
spoken, could tell from the Indian&rsquo;s expression that
something out of the ordinary had taken place.
&ldquo;What did he say, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He say,&rdquo; interrupted the guide, &ldquo;that he no like
way huskies act. Huskies tired but no want to lie
down and make bed in snowdrift. Huskies afraid
of something, very much afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That not all,&rdquo; Toma continued as a relieved
expression brightened Dick&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Raoul him not
sure, but see track mebbe made by snowshoe. Look
like snowshoe track only wind blow snow over it.
Raoul think Govereau&rsquo;s men come here tonight and
look for us. What you think? Mebbe camped not
far away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>For a brief moment, a look of apprehension, of
fear, swept through Dick. The supposition was not
entirely impossible. Experience had taught him that
Govereau was both an experienced woodsman and
an implacable enemy, a man who had the disconcerting
habit of putting in an appearance at times
when one least expected him. On the other hand,
Dick could not help but believe that the hated French
half-breed had not yet succeeded in catching up with
them. The incident at the river when he, Sandy and
Toma had crossed through the ice floe successfully,
must have delayed him considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he has had time to overtake us
yet,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;If any one has been here today,
it must be someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe you right. I like think so. All same
Govereau make you surprise once in a while. Fool
ever&rsquo;body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; rejoined Dick, &ldquo;but if Govereau
really is here, he&rsquo;s here and that&rsquo;s an end to it.
There&rsquo;s nothing that we can do except to fight him
and take our own risks. I think that you and Raoul
had better get into some dry clothes as quickly as
possible. A good supper and a sound sleep afterwards
are the first things to be considered. I wonder
if I&rsquo;d better wake Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him better sleep long time an&rsquo; wake up himself.
Him be all right then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Dick heeded this advice from Toma and a few
minutes later sat down to one of the most enjoyable
meals he had eaten in weeks. Then he and the young
Indian guide tumbled into the bunk above Sandy
and were almost instantly fast asleep, their weary
limbs stretching out in the luxurious softness of
a white rabbit sleeping-bag.</p>
<p>They woke on the following afternoon and
clambered down from their perch. To his amazement,
Dick beheld Sandy, somewhat pale but otherwise
quite his usual self, sitting at the table, opposite
their host. He was eating gruel from a bowl and
conversing in low tones to Raoul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Sandy!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, unable to conceal
his delight. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;m up,&rdquo; the voice of the young Scotchman
rose in jovial good humor as he glanced across
at his two friends, who were dressing hurriedly.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t expect me to lie in bed all night and all day
too, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but how do you feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy put down his spoon and swung round to
meet Dick&rsquo;s inquiring gaze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little shaky, I guess, but otherwise about the
same as usual. By the way, Dick, what happened
yesterday? When I woke up this morning, I
couldn&rsquo;t imagine where I was. And funny thing&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t remember very much of what took place on
the trail. Did I get hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Raoul tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick picked up his moccasins and began absently
to turn them in his hands. For Sandy&rsquo;s benefit, it
had occurred to him to gloss over the events of the
previous day, to give his friend as little information
as possible. It was not that Sandy&rsquo;s breakdown was
anything to be ashamed of, considering what he had
been through. It was not that, Dick told himself.
It was the possible effect the news might have on
him. For Sandy was proud, and the knowledge
of even a temporary weakness on his part would
be sure to cause him a good deal of humiliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You played out on the trail, Sandy,&rdquo; Dick stated
evenly. &ldquo;I was all in myself. I hope we never again
have so many obstacles and difficulties to contend
with. I can&rsquo;t imagine what would have happened
to us if Toma hadn&rsquo;t gone for help. We have Toma
and Raoul to thank for getting through safely yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toma is always doing remarkable things,&rdquo; said
Sandy. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help but admire the way he broke
trail through that storm. Wish I had half his endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;You no talk about me so much,&rdquo; Toma broke
forth, pretending to be angry, but grinning in spite
of himself. &ldquo;Me no like &rsquo;em all big words. Mebbe
make fun of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hurry up dress,&rdquo; interposed Raoul. &ldquo;My
sister wait in next room to bring something to eat.
Pretty soon we have breakfast middle of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; laughed Dick, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll hurry. I&rsquo;ll be
ready as soon as I put on these moccasins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was looking at Raoul as he spoke, but was
hardly prepared for what suddenly ensued. The
young Indian was abruptly on his feet and had
dashed forward to one side of the room, where he
caught up a rifle, which had been leaning there
against the wall. Amazed at first, Dick quickly
caught the significance of Raoul&rsquo;s actions, as there
came to his ears the dull tromping of feet outside,
followed quickly by a loud thumping at the door.
A moment later, a towering, heavy form broke into
the room and stood blinking across at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want!&rdquo; demanded Raoul, flourishing
his rifle.</p>
<p>The intruder closed the door behind him, his shifting
eyes regarding each of them in turn. He was
a big man, clothed almost entirely in fur, a parka
concealing the lower part of his face. As the four
other occupants of the room stood or sat watching
him, he shook off his heavy mitts, kicked the snow
from his feet and removed his parka. His general
appearance, Dick observed, was far from prepossessing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you want!&rdquo; repeated Raoul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be afeered o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; finally
grumbled their unexpected guest, rubbing one burly
hand against his bearded cheek. &ldquo;Put down yer
gun, brother, I ain&rsquo;t gonna hurt nobody. I jes&rsquo; came
in to get warm an&rsquo; ask fer something to eat. Been
hoofing it all the way from Twin Brothers Creek,
near the Big Smokey. Left there this morning.
Stranger in these parts. My name&rsquo;s Bill Watson.
Guess you don&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was conscious of a feeling of relief to learn
something of the intruder&rsquo;s identity. At least, he
was not one of Govereau&rsquo;s men. Then Dick felt
Toma&rsquo;s face brushing close to his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No like him,&rdquo; breathed the guide in a scarcely
audible whisper. &ldquo;Ever&rsquo;body watch out. See him
one time before with Govereau. He come to find
out if you and Sandy here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma drew back quickly as the stranger&rsquo;s gaze
turned again in their direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">OUTWITTING THE ENEMY</span></h2>
<p>Dick Kent had no reason to doubt that Toma&rsquo;s
stealthily imparted information concerning the true
identity of Bill Watson was correct. The man had
been sent by Govereau. His story of the long trek
from Twin Brothers Creek was a deliberate falsehood
intended to deceive Dick and his friends. He
was here as a spy to carry out certain instructions
from Govereau, the accomplishment of which would
probably result disastrously to their expedition.</p>
<p>In a few minutes following Toma&rsquo;s whispered
warning, Dick thought swiftly. Their safety and
the success of their plans depended upon immediate
action. Something had to be done before Watson
became aware that anyone suspected him.</p>
<p>The first step, of course, was to discover some
way to acquaint Sandy and Raoul with the stranger&rsquo;s
duplicity. This, of course, must be accomplished
secretly, and in a manner that would not arouse
Watson&rsquo;s slightest suspicion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only on some pretext I could get the two of
them outside,&rdquo; thought Dick, &ldquo;the rest would be
easy. Four of us would have no difficulty in taking
him prisoner. We would bind him hand and foot
and then Raoul could keep him here several days
while Sandy, Toma and I continued our journey
with the dog team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annette entered from the adjoining room at
Raoul&rsquo;s summons and began removing the dishes
from the table, in preparation for the meal for
Watson, Toma and Dick. Watson now occupied a
chair at one side of the room, and sat directly facing
Sandy. Raoul had moved forward and was assisting
his sister with her task, while Toma, like a restless
spirit, remained unseated, occasionally changing his
position from sheer nervousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had very much to eat today,&rdquo; Watson
informed them, producing an evil-smelling pipe and
lighting it with the stub of a match. &ldquo;Been too busy
mushing to think about it. Trail heavy all the
way, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strained silence followed. It was evident that
Watson intended to make himself perfectly at home,
for, a moment later, he stretched out his burly
legs, and, to Dick&rsquo;s disgust, spat on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you fellows bound for?&rdquo; he demanded
suddenly of Sandy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere in particular,&rdquo; replied the young
Scotchman non-committally. &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watson&rsquo;s face darkened with a scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; to tell neither if that&rsquo;s the way
you feel about it. Guess you never was taught no
manners, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy turned his head slightly and winked
covertly at Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offense intended, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man from Govereau&rsquo;s camp grunted something
under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little boys ain&rsquo;t got no business on the trail
anyway,&rdquo; he began again, this time in a scoffing
tone that caused an angry red to mount suddenly
in Sandy&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
<p>In his restless moving about, changing positions
often, Toma had presently come to a pause close
to Sandy and now stood absently tossing a small
object in his hand, his gaze directed toward Annette
and Raoul, who were completing preparations for
supper. Looking at him, no one would have suspected
that any thought, out of the ordinary, lay
at the back of the young half-breed&rsquo;s mind. His
face was expressionless, yet as Dick watched him,
there flashed from them unexpectedly a look that
could not be mistaken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>It was as if Toma had sent him some sort of a
signal. What was its meaning Dick could not possibly
imagine until, apparently by accident, the small
object, which looked like a brass buckle, fell from
the guide&rsquo;s hand and rolled under Sandy&rsquo;s chair.
As he stepped forward and stooped to get it, Dick
knew from the expression on Sandy&rsquo;s face that he,
too, had been warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper all ready,&rdquo; Raoul announced.</p>
<p>Watson bounded to his feet and was the first to
reach the table. Without waiting for further permission
he pulled out a chair and slumped into it.
Dick followed more leisurely, with Toma bringing
up the rear. As they approached directly behind
Watson&rsquo;s chair, Toma&rsquo;s hand shot out, poking Dick
in the ribs. Half-turning, the recipient of the blow
emitted a startled gasp as he perceived Toma&rsquo;s long
arms steal out and encircle the unsuspecting guest.</p>
<p>Watson and the chair swayed backward, then toppled
over, striking the floor with a resounding crash.
The heavy, powerful form rolled to one side, endeavoring
to break the iron grip of the young half-breed.
For a tense second Dick stood inactive, then
leaped to his friend&rsquo;s assistance. Attempting to
pinion Watson&rsquo;s arms, to his horror Dick saw their
opponent had actually succeeded in pulling a dangerous
looking automatic from his pocket and was
grimly endeavoring to use it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Dick seized Watson&rsquo;s wrist in his two hands, putting
forth his last ounce of strength in an effort to
force the gun from the man&rsquo;s grasp. In quick succession
three ear-splitting reports rang out. Annette
screamed. After that Dick was not quite sure what
was taking place during that confused wild scramble
on the floor until he felt the heavy body under him
relax and a voice triumphantly proclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess that ought to settle him for a
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With perspiration trickling down into his eyes,
Dick looked up. Raoul stood with a small stick of
wood in his hands and close beside him Sandy, a look
of triumph on his face, each surveying their now
helpless foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hit him half hard enough, Raoul,&rdquo;
Sandy protested. &ldquo;It was a good thing for him that
I didn&rsquo;t have that club, myself. I might have killed
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit &rsquo;em plenty hard,&rdquo; Raoul confessed, tossing
the stick back toward the fireplace. &ldquo;Tie him up
easy now. I go get rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Toma rose to their feet and a moment
later Raoul returned with a rope. Bound hand and
foot, Watson was lifted bodily and carried across
the room, where he was deposited not unkindly in
the selfsame bunk occupied by Sandy on the previous
night. Dick breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s over with,&rdquo; he declared thankfully.
&ldquo;All things considered, we&rsquo;ve been pretty
lucky so far. We&rsquo;ve beaten Govereau at every turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beaten but not licked,&rdquo; Sandy reminded him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to admit right here that he&rsquo;s a mighty
tough customer. It&rsquo;s a good thing Toma saw this
man, Watson, before. Otherwise things might have
turned out differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get an early start in the morning,&rdquo; said
Dick, as he moved back toward the supper table.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to meet any more visitors from Govereau&rsquo;s
camp. If Raoul is willing, I&rsquo;ll pay him tonight for
the team of huskies. What do you think would be
a fair price for them, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Raoul say he willing to sell for two hundred
dollars,&rdquo; answered the guide. &ldquo;That very cheap for
good team like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it two hundred and fifty. The additional
amount wouldn&rsquo;t begin to pay him for all the
kindness he has shown us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Dick reached in his pocket and
pulled out the roll of bills Factor MacLean had
given him on the day of their departure from Fort
du Lac, and, counting out the sum mentioned, passed
it over to Raoul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m not cheating you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;You buy best dog team in the country,&rdquo; Toma
stated enthusiastically. &ldquo;Mounted police use &rsquo;em
last winter to carry mail. Govereau go fast to catch
us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take us to reach mounted police
headquarters?&rdquo; inquired Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three, four day if nothing happen,&rdquo; their guide
answered. &ldquo;First day snow too heavy to make
trail good. After that mebbe get better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short time later, a low groan from Watson
attested to the fact that that gentleman was slowly
regaining consciousness. After considerable tossing
and rolling about, their captive finally opened his
eyes and presently called for a drink of water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeling better now?&rdquo; Dick inquired solicitously,
when he complied with the request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m feeling better,&rdquo; came Watson&rsquo;s smothered
retort as he glared up angrily at his questioner.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feelin&rsquo; a blamed sight better than you&rsquo;ll be
feelin&rsquo; in another day or two, I can tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought it all on yourself,&rdquo; Dick reminded
him. &ldquo;You had no business coming here to play the
part of a spy, in the first place. If you got hurt,
it&rsquo;s your own fault. All I&rsquo;m sorry about is that the
unpleasant little blow you received on top of your
head wasn&rsquo;t given to the man who sent you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; bluffed Watson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you know what I mean,&rdquo; Dick spoke
coldly, &ldquo;and please get the idea out of your mind
that we don&rsquo;t know who you are, and where you
came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did I come from?&rdquo; their prisoner
blustered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Govereau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you gonna do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was defiance in Watson&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean, what are we going to do with you,&rdquo;
Dick answered, &ldquo;I might as well tell you that we
haven&rsquo;t decided yet. A good deal depends upon the
way you behave yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thinking seriously of taking you outside
and putting a bullet in you,&rdquo; chimed in Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yuh better not, if you know what&rsquo;s best for you,&rdquo;
stormed Watson. &ldquo;If yuh try that, Govereau&rsquo;ll
come down here and make mince-meat out of yuh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might walk into the same kind of trap you
did,&rdquo; grinned Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Govereau now?&rdquo; asked Dick, shaking
his head at Sandy in an effort to check the useless
controversy. &ldquo;If you answer my questions truthfully,
we&rsquo;ll let you off a whole lot easier than we
would otherwise. We might even be induced to
give you something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t very far from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;About two miles away. We&rsquo;re camped in the
heavy timber jus&rsquo; back from the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he find out that we are stopping here
for the present with Raoul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of our men seen a dog team come up here
early yesterday morning. Govereau thought it might
be you, so he sent me over to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all he told you to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few minutes Watson lay, staring about him,
apparently quite oblivious of his surroundings. He
paid no attention to the last question put to him.
Finally he turned his head, his gaze meeting Dick&rsquo;s
squarely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows are in a mighty bad position, if
you want to know it,&rdquo; he suddenly blurted out.
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t one chance in ten thousand that you&rsquo;ll
ever get through alive. Your only hope is to go back
to the place you come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you for advice,&rdquo; said Dick
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; the same, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; yuh. I wouldn&rsquo;t take
the whole of upper Canada to be a standin&rsquo; in your
shoes just now. You&rsquo;re only a kid an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t realize
how bad a mess you&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy strode forward and put a hand on Dick&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use to bother with him, Dick,&rdquo; he exclaimed
in disgust. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just wasting time. He&rsquo;d keep
us talking here all night. Our best plan is to get
out of here as quickly as possible. Govereau may be
along any time to find out what has happened to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think same, too,&rdquo; Toma cut in. &ldquo;What you
say I hitch up huskies, and we start right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick glanced from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right. We can&rsquo;t any more than
lose our way in the dark, and we&rsquo;ve been lost
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are we going to do with him?&rdquo; Sandy
wondered, pointing at their prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to leave him here with Raoul,&rdquo; Dick
replied. Then he turned to Toma&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you object?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You can release
him sometime tomorrow. That will give us a chance
to be well on our way before Govereau learns what
has become of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raoul nodded his head, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, me keep &rsquo;em big fellow in bed. Bye
an&rsquo; bye feed him with spoon like little baby. How
you like that?&rdquo; he asked, turning to Watson.</p>
<p>The only reply from the man in the bunk was a
snort of rage as he twisted to one side and glared
helplessly about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">A JOURNEY THROUGH THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>The lonely journey through the dark proved to be
not nearly as difficult as Dick had expected. An
hour after their departure from Toma&rsquo;s cabin, the
little party emerged from the shelter of spruce and
pine, skirting the river, and drove forth upon a comparatively
open prairie, piled high with drifts.</p>
<p>Here the snow had been packed down by the wind
and the huskies were able to trot across its surface
without breaking through. They went forward at
such a brisk pace that Dick, running behind, was
forced to admit, breathlessly, to Toma:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep this up all night. Can&rsquo;t you slow
down once in a while, and give me a chance to catch
my breath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all ride now,&rdquo; the guide answered, motioning
Dick to a place on the sled in front of Sandy, who,
because of his weakened condition, had been riding
most of the time since they had left the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>A moment later, sitting at his friend&rsquo;s feet, Dick
was conscious of a new experience. He had never
ridden behind a team of huskies before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is wonderful,&rdquo; he remarked as the dogs
sprang forward at Toma&rsquo;s sharp word of command.
&ldquo;How easy they pull us, Sandy. If we keep on at
this rate, it won&rsquo;t take us long to reach mounted
police headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma, who was standing behind, with one hand
on the gee-pole, laughed good-naturedly over Dick&rsquo;s
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They go fast tonight,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but mebbe
tomorrow we come to soft snow in woods. No go
fast then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhere, close at hand, there broke forth a
weird, unearthly noise, a sound that echoed across
the stillness, causing both Dick and Sandy to sit up
very straight, hearts thumping excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; they demanded in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves,&rdquo; came the ready response. &ldquo;We see
plenty of wolves from now on. Rabbits very few
this year and wolves always hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em to feed on me,&rdquo; shivered
Sandy. &ldquo;What would we do if they should happen
along and suddenly decide to make a meal on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot,&rdquo; answered Dick, one hand stealing back
in the sled to make sure that in the hurry of their
departure they had not forgotten their rifles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;They not come yet,&rdquo; Toma reassured them.
&ldquo;Bye &rsquo;n&rsquo; bye weather get more cold, snow more deep,
wolves more hungry. Then we watch out. No
travel like this at night then. Me &rsquo;fraid wolves too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear that there&rsquo;s
something you&rsquo;re really afraid of, Toma. I&rsquo;d begun
to think that nothing could frighten you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another howl from the wolf pack, and Sandy&rsquo;s
mittened hand was pawing at Dick&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, Dick, I don&rsquo;t like this. Just listen to
that! Isn&rsquo;t it awful? Toma, are you sure they
won&rsquo;t come over here and try to gobble us up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty sure,&rdquo; answered the guide.</p>
<p>Sandy slouched back in his seat again, not entirely
convinced in his own mind that Toma was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;but why in the dickens
did the rabbits have to get scarce this year. I suppose
they heard we were coming along and just to
make our bad luck complete, hopped off to another
part of the country. I wonder why the wolves
didn&rsquo;t follow them, Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves no follow rabbits &rsquo;cause rabbits all dead,&rdquo;
patiently explained the half-breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who killed &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Sandy wanted to know.</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s whip cracked forth over the boys&rsquo; heads,
and the huskies sprang forward with redoubled
effort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbits no get killed&mdash;they sick an&rsquo; die,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;When you live in this country long time
you find out queer thing. Ever&rsquo; six, seven years see
many rabbits&mdash;like mosquitos in spring. Wolves an&rsquo;
coyotes all very fat then. Almost step on rabbits
when you walk through woods. When rabbits many
like that, one fellow him get sick, bye &rsquo;n&rsquo; bye another
rabbit him sick, too. Pretty soon no rabbits left&mdash;all
dead. No tell you why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following this explanation, Sandy lapsed into
silence for many moments. There was no sound at
all except that made by the pattering feet of the
huskies, and the crunching of the sled under them.
A belated moon had risen slowly from the distant
horizon, and in its pure, white light, the boys could
now discern objects, which a few hours before had
remained hidden. Looking about him, Dick saw
that the comparatively open space around them extended
southward for many miles, a vast, snow-covered
field, dotted here and there with small patches
of poplar.</p>
<p>They were passing one of these tree clumps a short
time later when, plainly discernible, not more than
fifty or a hundred yards to their right, Dick perceived
the huge body of a wolf gliding quickly along,
almost abreast of them. The boy&rsquo;s startled exclamation
drew the attention of Sandy and Toma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Follow us like that all night, mebbe,&rdquo; Toma
stated indifferently, &ldquo;he no come any closer. He
&rsquo;fraid us like we &rsquo;fraid him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t appear to be very frightened,&rdquo; came
Sandy&rsquo;s dry comment, &ldquo;and if he comes one step
nearer, I&rsquo;m going to teach him a few manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to save our ammunition.
We may need it badly a little later on. Besides,
I doubt very much whether one wolf would
dare to attack us. It&rsquo;s a full pack that I&rsquo;d be afraid
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there were more than one,&rdquo; rejoined Sandy,
peering fearfully across at the subject of their conversation,
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d be inclined to pull this blanket
over my head. I simply wouldn&rsquo;t want to see &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s amused laugh was broken short by a sudden
snarling from the huskies. This continued until
Toma cracked his whip and shouted out a sharp
word of command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No like &rsquo;em wolves either,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You
promise no be afraid if I tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; answered Dick. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look on other side.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Sandy and Dick, following directions, drew in a
quick breath of alarm. Two more wolves, equally
as large as the one on their right, trotted along unconcernedly
across the drifts, their furry forms
plainly distinguishable in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord help us!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy, with no thought
of irreverence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that?&rdquo; Dick wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No see wolves any more when morning comes,&rdquo;
Toma attempted to cheer them. &ldquo;You wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that the hours seemed interminable. Both
Dick and Sandy had forgotten about the novelty of
their ride. Intermittently Toma&rsquo;s whip cracked; the
huskies moved on; there was no sound except the
slight noise of their progress across the field of
white. On either side trotted the wolves, three dark
shapes, moving like ghosts, never once quickening or
slackening pace. It was with a sigh of relief that
Dick finally perceived the first faint glow of morning
across the eastern sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stop pretty soon and have something to eat,&rdquo;
announced Toma, breaking the long silence.</p>
<p>And a few minutes later, when they drew up before
a small log cabin, standing at the edge of a narrow
sheltering woodland, their companions of the
night&mdash;the three wolves&mdash;were nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I tell you,&rdquo; their guide reminded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, as usual,&rdquo; grumblingly admitted Sandy.
&ldquo;But tell me, Toma, whose place is this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Another friend&mdash;him live here,&rdquo; answered Toma.
&ldquo;We have breakfast, sleep two, three hours, then go
on some more. No like to travel night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took but a few moments to unhitch and feed the
huskies. Dick looked on with interest as Toma
threw each one of the dogs its ration of frozen fish.
Then the three boys strode forward toward the
cabin, upon the door of which the young half-breed
knocked loudly. But no answer ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess him gone away,&rdquo; Toma stated, and pushed
open the door. &ldquo;He no care if we stay here for little
while. Mebbe out on trap line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a fire was started in the fireplace, Dick and
Toma proceeded to get breakfast, while Sandy carried
in armloads of wood from the big pile outside.
They ate in front of a crackling flame, joking and
laughing amongst themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the help of the huskies,&rdquo; exulted Sandy,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll soon leave Pierre Govereau so far behind he&rsquo;ll
never catch up. Won&rsquo;t he be wild when he hears
how we&rsquo;ve outwitted him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure about that if I were you,&rdquo;
Dick cautioned. &ldquo;Govereau isn&rsquo;t the only man we&rsquo;ll
have to fear either. You know Henderson has accomplices
all along the line.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>So it proved.</p>
<p>In spite of their good intentions, their determination
to sleep only a few hours, it was morning of the
following day when Dick and Sandy awoke to find
their new team gone and Toma hunting around in
the underbrush some distance from camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">THE STOLEN HUSKIES</span></h2>
<p>The dogs were gone, and that was all there was
to it, Dick decided a moment later, after a shouted
conference with Toma. They would have to go on
on foot. It was discouraging, but it made Dick
more determined than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get to the fort now,&rdquo; Sandy grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re a darn sight closer than we were,&rdquo;
Dick tried to be cheerful.</p>
<p>They watched Toma circling the camp, looking
for tracks. Presently he came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fella steal dogs all right. Mebbe Henderson&rsquo;s
men; mebbe just plain thief. Who know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re gone anyway, and it&rsquo;s up to us to
make the best of it,&rdquo; Dick resigned himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
be slow work hauling this sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma had nothing more to say. His only answer
was to slip the breast band of a dog harness over one
shoulder and start the sled. Dick and Sandy followed
his lead and presently they were mushing
slowly out on the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>It was exceedingly tiresome business, and within
an hour all were leg weary. The snow had begun
to thaw a little, and was soggy underfoot. The sled
runners cut down deeply, making it exceedingly hard
pulling, even with so light a load as they had.</p>
<p>Long before noon they were resting frequently.
And it was with great thankfulness that they at last
made camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! That was a stiff jaunt,&rdquo; Dick panted,
lying flat on his back, even his iron endurance tested
to the utmost. Sandy was too winded to reply.
Toma alone seemed to make no note of it. Long
since the boys had ceased being surprised at any of
Toma&rsquo;s feats of muscular endurance.</p>
<p>They were about ready to dine on cold baked
beans and coffee, when Toma called their attention
to a movement ahead of them from the direction of
Fort Dunwoody. It proved to be a man and a dog
team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, we&rsquo;re going to meet somebody!&rdquo; Sandy
exclaimed incredulously. For days they had seen
few save enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe this isn&rsquo;t a friend,&rdquo; said Dick, dubiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Toma studied the man intently as he drew nearer.
Finally they could hear the cries of the driver to his
dogs and the occasional cracking of his long whip.
It was a white man; they could tell even at that distance
by the tail to tail hitch of the dogs. Most of
the Indians drove in fan formation, each dog attached
to separate tugs of varying lengths.</p>
<p>The stranger stopped some distance from them,
and came on more slowly. Evidently, he himself
was not too certain whether or not he was meeting
a hostile party.</p>
<p>They hailed each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Corporal Richardson of the Mounted,&rdquo;
called the lone driver of the dog team. &ldquo;Who are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cheered Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Kent and Sandy McClaren with a guide
from Fort du Lac,&rdquo; Dick called back through cupped
palms.</p>
<p>The policeman seemed satisfied. Cracking his
whip over the dogs, he speedily joined the young
travelers.</p>
<p>Corporal Richardson was dressed in a heavy fur
coat and parka. When near the campfire he pulled
open his great coat, disclosing the scarlet of his uniform
coat. He listened attentively to Dick&rsquo;s story
of their adventures, and he seemed favorably impressed
with both Dick and Sandy, though at first he
was somewhat suspicious of Toma.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;I left Fort Dunwoody a week ago,&rdquo; the policeman
told them, his steely eyes unwavering. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been hearing rumors of Bear Henderson&rsquo;s outbreak,
and I was sent up here to clear some of these trails.
Of course Henderson is rather foolish to think he
can whip the Mounted and the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,
but he&rsquo;s made rather a good try at it already.
Last report we had he&rsquo;d burned two trading posts,
and had captured three more. Mackenzie&rsquo;s Landing
has fallen to him, I understand. They say his next
move is Fort du Lac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy gasped at the revelations of the
policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know about the capture of Fort Good
Faith, and the imprisonment of Walter MacClaren,
my friend&rsquo;s uncle?&rdquo; Dick asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;We did not,&rdquo; replied Corporal Richardson.
&ldquo;That is news. But of course Henderson has made
a lot of moves we know nothing of. I suppose
you&rsquo;re after help. It was nervy of you young fellows
to break through Henderson&rsquo;s lines. You
know he isn&rsquo;t letting any one in or out of the far
north. A man&rsquo;s life isn&rsquo;t worth a cent who isn&rsquo;t
hand in glove with the outlaw. I&rsquo;m detailed to scout
the trail to Mackenzie&rsquo;s Landing&mdash;clear things up
there if possible. I wish I could go with you fellows,
but you&rsquo;ll have to go on alone and talk to the
Inspector. I doubt if you get help right away.
Every officer is out on the trail now, except the bare
few that guard the post. It looks like reserves
might be called out in spite of the fact that we don&rsquo;t
like to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think we may even have to go on to
Fort Good Faith alone?&rdquo; Dick spoke concernedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, but you may have to wait for a constable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; Dick cried desperately.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been delayed a week as it is. Sandy&rsquo;s uncle
must have help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Richardson sympathized with them, but
he said he would not build up false hopes. &ldquo;I suggest
you ask the Inspector for a special deputization.
In times like these every man will be forced into the
service who isn&rsquo;t an enemy of the crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy thrilled at this possibility. To
think of being for even a brief period a member of
the Royal Northwest Mounted Police was almost beyond
their dreams.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to be mushing,&rdquo; announced the policeman.
&ldquo;Too bad you lost your dogs. I passed a
team about ten miles back. I thought the driver
looked rather sneaky. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to describe
ordinary huskies. All I remember unusual about
the team was that the leader, an exceptionally big
fellow, limped with his left forefoot. Not much,
just a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our team, sure enough!&rdquo; Dick cried. &ldquo;Remember,
Sandy, how that leader limped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could catch up with the fellow,&rdquo; Sandy
gritted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now,&rdquo; Corporal Richardson shook
his head. &ldquo;I wish I could split my team with you,
but you see I&rsquo;ve only four and with two I&rsquo;d be slowed
up considerably. What you&rsquo;d better do is leave your
sled, and take what you need by shoulder pack.
If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corporal Richardson did not finish the sentence.
He seemed to start, and his eyes widened. His hand
flew to his chest. Across the snow came the ringing
crack of a distant rifle. The mounted policeman
dropped upon one elbow, as his startled companions
hastened to him.</p>
<p>Dick shook his fist at the hills in the direction the
shot seemed to have come from.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m hit pretty bad,&rdquo; the corporal
revived and whispered. Toma had thrown up the
sled as a sort of barricade, if any more shots were
fired, and Dick and Sandy commenced administering
first aid to the wounded policeman. The bullet had
struck under the shoulder blade at the back, and had
come out the right side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nasty wound,&rdquo; Dick said grimly&mdash;&ldquo;maybe a
lung is touched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather lucky for you fellows at that,&rdquo; the corporal
smiled gamely. &ldquo;Now you can use my dog
team to tote me back to the fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have any idea who shot you?&rdquo; Dick
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of Henderson&rsquo;s men without a doubt,&rdquo; was
the faint reply, &ldquo;the country&rsquo;s alive with them. But
we&rsquo;ll beat &rsquo;em yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick grimly agreed with him.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, no more shots were fired. Dick
judged the reason for this was that a single man had
attacked them and had lost courage after seeing he
had drawn blood in a party too strong for him. Yet
he could not be sure. At any moment they might
expect the sharpshooter lurking in the wooded hills
to drop one of them. If they were to move on to
the fort they could not remain sheltered from attack.</p>
<p>The limp body of the corporal was speedily transferred
to his sled, after some of the packs had been
thrown aside. Dick picked up the gee-pole, Toma
took the lead, and Sandy cracked the long whip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were off, the dogs yelping eagerly down the
back trail, overjoyed at hitting the home trail so
soon.</p>
<p>For nearly an hour they advanced at a fast rate
of speed, Sandy and Dick changing off advance
guard with Toma. Then they entered a long ravine,
crested with spruce and jackpine. As yet no sign of
the man who had shot the corporal appeared. Then,
without warning, from the brow of the ravine,
puffed the smoke of a rifle. A bullet fanned Dick&rsquo;s
cheek, and he paused and fired at the distant smoke
at the top of the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mush! Mush!&rdquo; shouted Sandy to the dogs, cracking
the long whip.</p>
<p>The dogs responded nobly, drawing the sled, carrying
the wounded officer, so fast that the boys
could hardly keep up.</p>
<p>Again the hidden rifle cracked from the top of the
ravine. This time one dog gave a sharp yelp,
leaped into the air and fell kicking his last in a tangle
of harness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s killed a dog!&rdquo; cried Dick angrily. &ldquo;Quick,
get him out of the harness so we can go on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>The three remaining huskies were growling and
snarling in a mess, and it was some minutes before
Sandy and Toma could straighten them out, cut the
dead dog from his harness and start on again.
Meanwhile Dick emptied his rifle at the brow of the
ravine, taking a chance on hitting whoever was
skulking there with such deadly intent.</p>
<p>On their way again, the fast moving sled proved
an elusive target for the sharpshooter. He shot
three times without effect. Swiftly they neared a
point where the ravine widened out into a low walled
valley, which was almost barren of vegetation.
Once on this clear space they would be safe, for there
was no cover within rifle range for the man who was
dogging them.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy were almost on the point of giving
a shout of triumph when the hidden rifle cracked
again and another dog dropped in the harness. The
sled stopped, and once more the excited dogs got
themselves in a bad mix-up. At the mercy of the
mysterious and deadly rifle, the boys attacked the
tangled harness and dogs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">A HUNGRY PACK</span></h2>
<p>Scarcely had they cut loose the fallen dog when
the rifle sounded again and the lead dog dropped to
his haunches, failing to rise again. Dick put the dog
out of misery with a shot from his rifle, then turned
to Toma and Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get that fellow out of his nest.
He&rsquo;s playing with us. As soon as he finishes with
the dogs he&rsquo;ll start in on us. We might as well die
fighting. Follow me.&rdquo; Dick wheeled and started up
the hill, firing his rifle as he went, Sandy and Toma
not far behind.</p>
<p>The man on the rim of the ravine seemed taken
by surprise. His shots went wild. Only one came
close, and that tore through Sandy&rsquo;s mackinaw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Shouting at the top of their voices, the boys
reached the top of the ravine. A running figure was
just disappearing over a knoll ahead of them. Dick
paused a moment, levelled his rifle and fired quickly.
The figure, some hundred yards distant, leaped
high, as if hit, and ran on limping. Toma and
Sandy also fired, but did not hit. They ran on after
the man a little way, then fearing to leave the wounded
officer too long alone, they hurried back, certain
they had routed the sharpshooter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; Dick said, as they trotted down
the slope of the ravine, &ldquo;&mdash;not a scratch and he was
sure shooting close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kind of wish I was in Corporal Richardson&rsquo;s
place when I think of going on with one dog,&rdquo; Sandy
changed the subject, making light of his narrow
escape. &ldquo;Means we&rsquo;ve got to buckle into the harness
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma paused as they reached the sled. They
could see him looking up at the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heap snow come soon,&rdquo; the imperturbable
weather prophet announced. &ldquo;Make um wolves
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy did not think seriously of Toma&rsquo;s
prophecy, for they were intent on the hard work ahead,
and already were stepping into the places vacated
by the dead dogs.</p>
<p>Again they toiled out on the trail to Fort Dunwoody,
hauling the wounded man, who was muttering
to himself now in a delirious state brought on
by rising fever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>In an hour it had begun to snow, but the boys
kept on. Thicker and thicker fell the soft, white
flakes, until they could see no more than twenty feet
ahead. It was a wet snow, and made pulling the
sled harder than ever. The runners seemed to drag
like lead upon the aching shoulders of the three.
They were glad when darkness fell and they were
forced to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for an all-night snow storm, I guess,&rdquo;
Dick observed, as the fire he was trying to start went
out for a third time, and he had to enlist the aid of
Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to sleep for a week,&rdquo; said Sandy, from
where he was trying to make the wounded officer
more comfortable. &ldquo;That falling snow is just like
a bedtime story that really does put a fellow to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rolled into their sleeping bags as soon as
they had appeased their appetites, not troubling to
keep watch. All night the snow fell, and in the
morning they awakened almost smothered with the
wet drifts. The world was all fresh and white like
a new blanket, but they had not taken ten steps before
they knew they would make little progress that
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a crust would only freeze over the snow we
could get along faster,&rdquo; Dick bewailed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Corporal Richardson seemed a little better after
the night&rsquo;s rest. His fever had gone down and an
examination of the wound showed it to be coming
along as well as could be expected. He was very
weak, however, from loss of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; the officer asked Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fifty miles north of Fort Dunwoody with
only one dog,&rdquo; Dick replied. &ldquo;You were unconscious
yesterday during the scrap we had with the
same fellow who hit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I seemed to have had delirium,&rdquo; replied the
corporal. &ldquo;I imagined I heard shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you didn&rsquo;t need your imagination to hear
that yesterday,&rdquo; Dick assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a wonder if you get through,&rdquo; the officer
said, &ldquo;better leave me along the trail somewhere.
There&rsquo;s an abandoned cabin a few miles this side of
Badge Lake. You&rsquo;ll strike it if you follow the long
ridge. Put me off there with some grub and then
have Inspector Dawson send a man out after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we couldn&rsquo;t do anything like that,&rdquo; Dick returned
firmly. &ldquo;In your condition you need medical
care as soon as you can get it. As long as we can
stand you&rsquo;re going to stay on this sled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if to bear out Dick&rsquo;s words, the officer fainted
dead away.</p>
<p>Alarmed, Dick put a cup of melted snow to the
pale lips. The corporal had just aroused enough to
drink when a sound from across the snow startled
Dick so that he spilled the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to that!&rdquo; ejaculated Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it,&rdquo; Dick replied.</p>
<p>Long, weird, mournful, the howl of a wolf rose
and fell in the distance. It was the hunger cry of the
most savage denizen of the northland wilds. Deep
snow had made hunting hard for the wolves, and
they were beginning to take notice of the man prey
of the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him hungry,&rdquo; grunted Toma.</p>
<p>They set off on the trail once more. A half mile
they struggled along with the sled, when another
wolf howled from a different quarter. This time the
cry was answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves come together for big hunt,&rdquo; Toma explained,
with his usual absence of emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s hoping they don&rsquo;t pick on us,&rdquo; Sandy remarked.</p>
<p>Dick was silent. His face was haggard. The
troubles of the trail were weighing heavily on his
sturdy shoulders, and this new danger of the northland
taxed his courage to the utmost. Yet he did not
falter. Instead, his words were cheerful, though
they came from drawn lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we have a few shots left in our rifles,&rdquo;
said Dick meaningly. &ldquo;Those wolves better not
come too close.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Few shots is right,&rdquo; Sandy came back dishearteningly.
&ldquo;Dick, do you know we have only about
ten shots left for each of the rifles? And we had
the hard luck to unload Corporal Richardson&rsquo;s ammunition
when we put him on the sled. All he has
is a belt full of revolver cartridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s hands clenched on the strap with which he
was helping pull the sled. &ldquo;Makes no difference,
Sandy. After we&rsquo;ve escaped all these human wolves
that have been after us, I guess we can handle the
animals all right.&rdquo; But he was not quite so sure as
he tried to make Sandy believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves eat um dead dogs back trail,&rdquo; Toma
called from the rear of the sled, where he was following
up after a stiff job of breaking trail.</p>
<p>All afternoon the cries of the gathering pack could
be heard, now near, now far. Once it seemed they
were all around them. Then the boys redoubled
their efforts on the heavy sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to pull into that cabin the corporal
mentioned before long,&rdquo; Dick said worriedly, as he
changed places with Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; Sandy replied. &ldquo;The
corporal was probably estimating the distance if we
made time with a good dog team&mdash;but we haven&rsquo;t
gone more than five miles today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>They made no stop for a mid-day meal, chewing
raw bacon while toiling on the trail. The fear of
the wolves had entered their hearts yet they would
not let one another feel that fear by any spoken
word.</p>
<p>Near nightfall they were certain the wolves were
trailing them, and they could not hide it from one
another. Far in the rear they could hear the hunting
cry of the pack, and it was blood-curdling.</p>
<p>While the sun still shone over the western skyline,
the first of the wolf pack appeared behind, and the
boys knew that they were in for trouble.</p>
<p>The leader of the wolves was old and wise. For
a time he held the pack of nearly thirty gaunt, gray
wolves out of rifle range, waiting for dark. But
hunger could not be denied. The less wise of the
pack forged ahead, and the rifles of the three boys
spoke with deadly effect.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s toll was three wolves before he emptied his
magazine. Sandy shot one and thought he had killed
another, but the animal seemed only stunned, and
after a minute leaped up and came on again at a
swinging lope, to be dropped by a shot from Dick,
who had reloaded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Toma did not fire, however. Instead, without any
orders from Dick or Sandy, he made camp in a patch
of scrub pine and spruce, where there was plenty of
dead wood. Speedily he made a fire. When Dick
and Sandy had exhausted their ammunition, and had
gone for Corporal Richardson&rsquo;s revolver, a huge fire
was roaring and crackling before the upturned sled,
in whose shelter rested the corporal.</p>
<p>The wolves had drawn off out of gunshot now.
Some of them were devouring their comrades that
had fallen. When darkness crept over the little camp
the wolves had completely surrounded it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to save our cartridges,&rdquo; Dick said at
last. &ldquo;Toma, how many have you left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just gun full up,&rdquo; replied Toma, which meant he
had the magazine of his repeater full&mdash;eight shots.</p>
<p>Dick was fingering Corporal Richardson&rsquo;s revolver.
He was unaccustomed to handling a revolver
and comprehended he could do little real damage
with the small arm, having always used a rifle.
Sandy was no better than he, and when Dick asked
Toma if he could shoot with a revolver with accuracy,
the guide shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re slinking around us in a circle now,&rdquo;
Sandy reported fearfully, as the shadows deepened.</p>
<p>As he had said, now and again a dark, sinister
form glided across the snow from shrub to shrub,
skirting the firelight. Here and there, one of the
pack sat on his haunches, his beady eyes fixed on the
camp, while his mouth slavered. Frequently one of
the number raised his nose to the sky and sounded
the hunger howl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>The wolves feared the campfire, and Toma explained
that as long as they could keep the fire going
they need not fear any very dangerous attack. And
even if the wolves did rush them they could be repelled
by fire brands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see what they do when I throw fire,&rdquo;
Dick said presently. He picked out the nearest shadowy
form, and drawing a flaming stick from the
fire, threw it at the wolf. His aim was good and
the animal snarled horribly as the fire fell within a
few feet of its feet.</p>
<p>It was close to midnight when Toma confided to
Dick and Sandy what they both feared. The wolves
were gaining in number as wanderers joined the pack
surrounding them. The places of those they had
killed earlier in the day, and the few they had managed
to pick off after dark were being filled by other
ravenous beasts.</p>
<p>There would be no sleep in the camp that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">THE CIRCLE OF DEATH</span></h2>
<p>Toma had cut a huge stack of wood, and it was
well he did, for the moment the fire died down the
wolves drew closer. In fact they seemed to taunt
the boys into using the last of their ammunition in
firing at the difficult targets they made.</p>
<p>The one dog was whimpering with fear and cowering
under the legs of his masters in abject fear.
Sometimes, however, a low whine sounded among
the wolves, at which the husky pricked up his ears
and did not seem so frightened. Toma tied the dog
to the sled with a thong of moose-hide.</p>
<p>As the night wore away, Dick and Sandy risked
shot after shot at the wolves, and now and again
they dropped a skulking shadow. But usually they
missed, since Toma objected to giving up his rifle,
and they were forced to use the corporal&rsquo;s revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you suppose we can hold out?&rdquo;
Sandy asked in a strained voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see no reason why we can&rsquo;t hold out until they
leave,&rdquo; Dick replied with more confidence than he
felt. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve plenty of firewood. As long as we
have fire to fight with we&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we know they&rsquo;ll leave?&rdquo; Sandy wanted
to know.</p>
<p>Dick shuddered a little, and did not answer. He
saw a gray shape loom up at the edge of the firelight,
and raising the revolver, fired quickly. He gave a
cry of satisfaction as he saw the gaunt beast leap
into the air and fall, kicking its last.</p>
<p>There followed a rush of hungry wolves for their
fallen companion. Horrified, the boys watched the
dead wolf torn to pieces by the pack. Dick emptied
his revolver into the writhing mass. He could not
help but hit, and he killed another wolf, wounding
two others, which the pack finished.</p>
<p>Sandy began throwing burning brands at the
wolves, and they drew off once more into the darkness,
where they paced nervously back and forth,
growling and snarling.</p>
<p>The boys decided that one of them should try to
sleep while the other two watched. Dick arranged
three twigs in one hand for Sandy and Toma to
draw from. The one with the shortest twig, after
the draw, was to be the lucky one. Sandy drew the
shortest. But after a half hour of futile tossing
about, he gave it up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; Sandy joined the haggard watchers at
the fire. &ldquo;One of you fellows try it. I couldn&rsquo;t
sleep in a million years with those devils out there
waiting to gobble me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can either,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Toma,
you&rsquo;d better try it. One of us had better get some
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide grunted assent, and rolled into his sleeping
bag, which once had been his brother&rsquo;s. In a
few minutes Toma was breathing steadily in sound
slumber. His calmness gave the boys courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he can sleep I guess we hadn&rsquo;t ought to feel
so nervous,&rdquo; Sandy observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard old sourdoughs say an Indian never
lets the nearness of death trouble him when he can&rsquo;t
get away from it,&rdquo; Dick related, trying to get his
own mind and Sandy&rsquo;s off their perilous predicament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish I was an Indian then,&rdquo; Sandy
sighed, &ldquo;&mdash;for the present anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The renewed and increased restlessness of their
dog attracted their attention then, and they watched
him straining at the moosehide leash.</p>
<p>Dick caught the dog trying to chew through the
thong and spoke sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny why he wants to get away,&rdquo; Dick mused
aloud. &ldquo;One would think the dog would realize his
danger and want to stay near the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Corporal Richardson&rsquo;s voice sounded from his
blankets. The officer had awakened and had overheard
Dick&rsquo;s remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a female wolf out there&mdash;several of
them,&rdquo; the veteran northerner answered Dick.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s calling to the dog. It&rsquo;s the mate call of the
wolf and the dog understands it. But only the wisest
of she-wolves understand how to use the call to
lure meat for their stomachs. That dog wouldn&rsquo;t
last three minutes once he left the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel now?&rdquo; Dick asked, going to
the wounded man&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; answered the officer, &ldquo;but my side
is stiff and mighty sore. I&rsquo;ll be flat on my back for
a couple of weeks yet. Couldn&rsquo;t be worse luck now
that the Inspector needs every man of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you really think we have a good chance
escaping from the wolf pack?&rdquo; Dick eagerly seized
at a grain of encouragement.</p>
<p>The corporal did not answer immediately. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
have a lot bigger chance if you left me here in the
morning,&rdquo; said the corporal steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave you here!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed. &ldquo;What do
you think we are&mdash;cowards?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not, Dick Kent,&rdquo; replied the policeman.
&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t make me any less a burden.
With this wolf pack surrounding you you&rsquo;ll do well
to get away from camp at all, say nothing of hauling
me along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re with you anyway,&rdquo; Dick concluded
decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; the officer turned a little, stifling a
groan at the movement, &ldquo;the wolves may scare up
moose or caribou before morning. If they do they&rsquo;ll
soon leave us alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation had weakened the corporal, and
Dick soon left him to rest, joining Sandy. The boys
discussed the situation, listening to the fearful howls
of the wolves, hoping against hope that as Corporal
Richardson had said, they might find other game
before morning.</p>
<p>After two hours of sound slumber, Toma quietly
arose and joined the two at the fireside. He said
little, but set to work cutting down more wood, and
breaking it up into firewood lengths.</p>
<p>Morning dawned, cold and gray. Dick and Sandy
were worn from loss of sleep. Silently they waited
for the wolves to depart. But with the sun an hour
high the pack still circled the camp, tongues lolling,
jaws slavering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they never leave!&rdquo; Sandy&rsquo;s voice faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf much hungry!&rdquo; Toma grunted. &ldquo;Maybe
um leave, we start. Sometime they do.&rdquo; He looked
at Dick to see what he thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Dick surveyed the menacing circle of wolves.
They had grown bolder as their hunger increased.
Could they hitch up the dog and break out of that
circle of death?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think we have a chance to get out of here,
Toma, we&rsquo;ll try it,&rdquo; Dick grimly returned a moment
later. &ldquo;Anything but this suspense suits me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boys packed up the wolves grew more uneasy
and shifted closer. Toma scarcely could manage
the husky as he hitched it to the sled. The young
guide held his rifle in one hand, working at a disadvantage
so that he might be prepared to shoot at
a moment&rsquo;s notice. Toma&rsquo;s was the only rifle left in
which there was ammunition, and Dick had shot
away all the revolver cartridges during the night.</p>
<p>It was with many misgivings that a few minutes
later they took their places for the dash through the
wolves.</p>
<p>Toma took the lead, with the rifle, Sandy held the
dog, while Dick took up the rear, swinging the camp
axe.</p>
<p>Slowly, in grim silence, they pulled away from the
fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>A hundred feet away they discovered they never
would get through the circle. For, instead of retreating,
the wolves dashed this way and that, then
rushed them in a body. Sandy&rsquo;s cry of terror was
drowned by the crack of Toma&rsquo;s rifle and Dick&rsquo;s
hoarse shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the fire! We can&rsquo;t make it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Toma&rsquo;s rifle was empty, and with clubbed
rifle and axe they were left to fight their way back
to the campfire. Slashing with razor fangs, the
wolves leaped in and out. Dick wrought havoc with
the axe, and Toma ploughed his way through the
snarling, writhing mass like a Hercules. When the
guide broke through he ran to the fire and commenced
throwing coals and burning sticks with his
mittens, until the air was filled with flying embers.
Howls of pain followed as the hot coals burned the
wolves. The scent of singed hair and burning flesh
arose.</p>
<p>At last the wolves drew off reluctantly, leaving
behind them a trail of wounded and dying. In the
repulsion of the attack the boys had slain nine wolves
and wounded seven. They could see the hairy bodies
of the dead lying scattered all the way from where
the fight had begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wood not last much longer,&rdquo; Toma&rsquo;s voice
startled Dick.</p>
<p>Dick hastily inspected the patch of wood in which
they had camped. As Toma had said, they soon
would be out of firewood. And the nearest wood
was three hundred yards away&mdash;outside the circle
of death.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy shuddered; Corporal Richardson
stirred and moaned; Toma began quietly gathering
the chips and twigs; half buried in the snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">SANDY DISAPPEARS</span></h2>
<p>Sitting by the fire, conscious presently of a light
step at his side and a friendly hand on his shoulder,
Dick turned and looked up into Sandy&rsquo;s face, as his
chum spoke in a voice husky with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve about played our last card,&rdquo; said
Sandy. &ldquo;Right now it doesn&rsquo;t look as if Fort Dunwoody
was very close, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not very close,&rdquo; Dick was obliged to answer,
as his tired eyes swept the narrowing circle of timber
wolves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done the best we could anyway,&rdquo; Sandy
went on dejectedly. &ldquo;I guess my Uncle Walter
won&rsquo;t receive a whole lot of help from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, I used to think you were an optimist,&rdquo;
declared Dick, &ldquo;but now I know you&rsquo;re a born pessimist.
Why don&rsquo;t you try to cheer up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Sandy glanced about at the wolves. A scowl
puckered his usually placid brow. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be very
cheerful with those fellows waiting for us,&rdquo; he said
shortly. &ldquo;Do you know I sometimes think that big
one with the shaggy head actually grins at me? If
he thinks he&rsquo;s going to pick a whole lot of meat off
my bones he&rsquo;s badly mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick grinned in spite of himself.
&ldquo;Exactly what do you mean, Sandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a whole lot thinner than I was. Toma
would make better eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture, Toma, who had been cutting
what little wood remained, strode forward with an
almost excited look on his face. &ldquo;I know what do
now,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;We no got firewood; plenty
over by trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that,&rdquo; Sandy responded impatiently,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;re a long ways from being over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me ketch um good idea. No can go to wood
with wolves there. We move fire to wood; move
um little at time, one feet, two feet&mdash;bye and bye we
get there&mdash;mebbe by night we travel fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma was right. At nightfall they had accomplished
the unusual feat of moving the fire to another
patch of wood. And with the first snarling approach
of the ravenous wolves a replenished fire
sprang up to beat them back. The boys, in exuberance,
piled more and more wood on the fire until it
leaped five feet into the still, frosty air, and grew so
hot it melted a circle of snow about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Dick breathed a sigh of satisfaction as he crawled
into his blankets hours later. It had been decided
that Sandy was to stand first watch with Toma.
Tonight, Dick decided grimly, he would make the
most of the hours allotted him for sleep. He intended
to follow Toma&rsquo;s example and forget everything
in the complete relaxation of weary mind and
muscles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to fight this thing through,&rdquo; he reminded
himself, stretching his long legs out before the campfire
and composing himself for sleep. A few minutes
later, while watching Sandy nervously pacing to
and fro, he forgot all his troubles in a happy loss of
consciousness that carried him away to a land where
wolves, blizzards and scar faced Indians did not once
trouble him.</p>
<p>He was awakened by Toma shaking him by the
shoulder. &ldquo;Big wolf eat you up if sleep like that,&rdquo;
declared the young guide goodnaturedly.</p>
<p>Dick jumped up, once more mentally alert, and
shortly piled more wood on the fire, commencing his
lonely vigil. He scanned the fringe of the firelight
for the skulking shapes, which had become so dreadfully
familiar, but he could see none&mdash;not a single
prowling form anywhere. He decided that the
wolves had moved further back from the fire. Several
times he believed he heard a deep-throated snarl,
but he was not sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; he breathed fervently, &ldquo;so
that we can continue on our way to Fort Dunwoody.
We&rsquo;ve lost too much time already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off to his right a faint glow suffused the east.
In another hour, if the wolves really were gone, they
might continue their slow progress, and, barring
emergencies, might reasonably expect to arrive at the
mounted police barracks in about three days.</p>
<p>With the first grin in hours brightening his face,
Dick set about preparing breakfast. He had a frying
pan over the fire and was melting snow for coffee.
It was so quiet around him that he imagined he
could hear the low, irregular breathing of Corporal
Richardson. Then, presently Toma stirred, stretched
out one arm and yawned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I get up,&rdquo; the guide announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you do,&rdquo; Dick replied, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d go
over and wake Sandy. I&rsquo;ve kept his watch for him,
and if I wasn&rsquo;t so busy getting breakfast I&rsquo;d go over
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was adding coffee to the boiling water when
Toma returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you wake him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The half breed endeavored to speak, but no sound
came from his trembling lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Dick inquired, trying to be
calm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, him gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s heart took a sickening plunge.</p>
<p>The light was strong enough now so that they
could see that the wolves were gone, but this happy
discovery was not so encouraging with the disappearance
of Sandy.</p>
<p>Horrified at first, at the thought that Sandy must
have been eaten by the wolves, Dick and Toma began
a minute search of the vicinity. They found tracks,
but no sign of Sandy. If the departed wolves had
slain Dick&rsquo;s chum there would have been traces left,
at least bits of clothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">THE MAN FROM CROOKED STICK RIVER</span></h2>
<p>If, as Dick suspected possible, Pierre Govereau
had overtaken them again and somehow made off
with Sandy, what then could they do? Corporal
Richardson must go on to the post at all hazards.
The infection in the officer&rsquo;s wound would kill him
unless medical aid were procured soon. Yet Dick
could not leave without knowing what had happened
to Sandy, and making a sincere effort to find his
chum. And in that strange country he could not
find his way without the aid of Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good idea what might have happened to
Sandy,&rdquo; Dick mused aloud a little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say?&rdquo; Toma eagerly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s walked in his sleep two or three times in
his life that I know about, and last night he must
have done it again. Now I&rsquo;m sure he left the fire
after the wolves were gone. If he did then he might
have fallen into Govereau&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo; Dick strode
back and forth in the snow, almost beside himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if some friend would only come along on
the way to Fort Dunwoody,&rdquo; Dick exclaimed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take um sick fella to cabin,&rdquo; Toma suggested.
&ldquo;We leave um there when go look for
Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At his wit&rsquo;s end Toma&rsquo;s suggestion seemed the
only way out. Dick felt his duty to Sandy even
greater than that to the minion of the northland law,
and he would not exactly be deserting the policeman
if he left him with food and firewood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing to do,&rdquo; Corporal Richardson
spoke up from his blankets. &ldquo;The Indian has it
right. The cabin is between six and eight miles
from here. You can take me there and come back
and take up young McClaren&rsquo;s trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was glad to hear the officer&rsquo;s voice, and to
learn that he was once more rational, with abated
fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all right with you, corporal, that&rsquo;s what
we&rsquo;ll do. Toma, let&rsquo;s hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the camp where they had been
held up a day and two nights had been deserted and
out across the vast, endless expanse of snow, Toma
and Dick toiled in the dog traces, dragging the
wounded policeman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>They had gone some two miles and were resting
when suddenly they were startled by the sound of a
dog driver&rsquo;s voice from over the knoll they had just
coasted down. Was it friend or enemy? Dick
prayed it was a friend as he hurried to the top of
the little hill and looked.</p>
<p>A team of eight dogs, followed by a lone man,
swinging a long whip, was coming along the trail
they had made in the snow. Dick waited till the man
had come a little nearer. Then he revealed himself.
The man saw him almost immediately, and drew his
dog team to a slower pace. The stranger seemed
suspicious as to Dick&rsquo;s identity, but the evident distress
of the young man on the hill reassured him.
He came on to within hailing distance, and stopped
his team, raising his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re one of that Henderson gang,&rdquo; called
the man threateningly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll plug you where you
stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick breathed a sigh of relief. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re bound for
Fort Dunwoody,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a wounded
policeman on our sled and have only one dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Satisfied that Dick was telling the truth, the
shouted to his dogs and came on. A moment later
he joined Dick and Toma alongside the sled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gar, I tink I never get out of dat country.&rdquo;
the newcomer, appearing to be a French-Indian,
mopped his brow. &ldquo;That Pierre Govereau one tough
customer. Yah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came in a nick of time,&rdquo; Dick returned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of our party has disappeared, we think he&rsquo;s
been captured. Now we&rsquo;re trying to get a wounded
policeman to a place of safety while I and my guide
take a look for my chum. My name&rsquo;s Dick Kent,&rdquo;
he held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, I&rsquo;m Gaston Leroi,&rdquo; announced the stranger,
shaking with French warmth, &ldquo;that Henderson&rsquo;s
man Govereau kill my partner up on Crooked Stick
River. I get away pretty lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s lucky for us you got away,&rdquo; Dick replied
with spirit. He stepped to the sled and stopped
over the wounded officer. &ldquo;Corporal Richardson,
here&rsquo;s a man who can help us out,&rdquo; Dick told the
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; murmured the policeman. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaston Leroi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaston Leroi!&rdquo; exclaimed the corporal with
more strength in his voice than had been there for
hours. &ldquo;Not the trapper Leroi. Hey! Bring him
around where I can see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of the wounded man&rsquo;s voice the
French trapper had leaped forward where he could
see the officer&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gar!&rdquo; exclaimed Leroi. &ldquo;George Richardson!
What them fellers do to you, George?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Dick was overjoyed to discover the men were old
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaston, you won&rsquo;t mind doing something for
me?&rdquo; he heard the corporal saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sacre diable! Do I mind!&rdquo; Gaston exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; the corporal went on, &ldquo;these young
fellows want to go back and look for their partner,
but they won&rsquo;t leave me. Could you haul me to the
fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapper vociferously expressed his willingness
to do this for his friend, Constable Richardson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re out of ammunition too,&rdquo; revealed the
corporal. &ldquo;Just had a long fight with a pack of
hungry wolves. Can you spare some ammunition,
Gaston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of gun you got?&rdquo; the trapper turned
to Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross 30.30,&rdquo; Dick replied anxiously.</p>
<p>Leroi&rsquo;s face fell. He turned to Toma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got um 45.70 Winchester,&rdquo; Toma anticipated
the trapper&rsquo;s question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, I use 45.70!&rdquo; Gaston Leroi exclaimed with
pleasure and turned back to Dick, saying: &ldquo;I use
revolver. Like heem better dan rifle. I take your
gun. You take mine. Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; replied Dick gratefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Leroi dived into his packs and soon brought out
several boxes of ammunition, with which Dick and
Toma filled their pockets.</p>
<p>A half hour later Dick and Toma bid goodbye
to Gaston Leroi, and watched his dog team, hauling
the wounded corporal, disappear over a long hill.
Then the two boys set out over the back trail at a
jog trot. They were determined not to rest their
heads until they had discovered what had become of
Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it was Govereau?&rdquo; Dick asked
Toma as they hurried along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not know,&rdquo; replied Toma, who was slightly
in the lead. &ldquo;Tracks show only two fella keetch
Sandy. Hope snow no more; if not we trail um
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not speak again until they had reached
the scene of their battle with the wolves, where they
picked up the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going north,&rdquo; Dick spoke, after studying
the tracks. &ldquo;It must be some of Henderson&rsquo;s men,
though it seems queer Govereau would come this
far south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Govereau, he bad fella; he go everywhere.
No &rsquo;fraid anybody. Mebbe I see that Many Scar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Dick fell silent at the mention of the scar faced
Indian. He knew Toma was thinking of his dead
brother, and was planning revenge if he met the
murderer, who he believed to be the scar faced
Indian. Dick knew nothing to say which would
change Toma&rsquo;s mind in this respect, so he said nothing
as they forged onward at a mile-eating pace.</p>
<p>They had traveled nearly ten miles into a deeply
wooded vicinity, when the tracks began to grow
fresher, and they slowed their pace. Presently they
rounded a bend, and in a tiny valley, drained by a
winding, frozen creek, they came upon an Indian
village of a dozen tepees.</p>
<p>Toma seemed as surprised as Dick at the discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um war party,&rdquo; Toma replied immediately.
&ldquo;No good Injun if um fight White Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell they&rsquo;re a war party?&rdquo; inquired
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No squaws, no papooses,&rdquo; replied Toma abruptly.</p>
<p>As Toma had said there were no women or children
to be seen in the camp. And at different points
along the fringe of trees around the clearing, Dick
made out dusky sentinels, armed with long rifles,
with feathers in their beaver bonnets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tracks lead down into the village, so Sandy
must be there somewhere,&rdquo; Dick mused aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>The larger portion of the party of Indians who
had thrown up their caribou hide tepees in the valley,
seemed to be absent. Here and there a warrior
squatted before a cooking fire, his rifle leaning close
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Dick suddenly pointed.</p>
<p>A white man had come out of one of the tepees
and was walking slowly toward the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see um,&rdquo; said Toma. &ldquo;Guess him one Govereau&rsquo;s
men. Huh? Him Henderson got plenty
bad Indian work for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Govereau has joined forces with these Indians,&rdquo;
Dick&rsquo;s spirits fell. &ldquo;It will be one big job
getting Sandy away from him now. I wonder which
tepee he is in&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; he was about to wonder if
Sandy was alive, but dared not trust the words on
his tongue. It was too horrible to speak of&mdash;that
Pierre Govereau had murdered his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wait till dark,&rdquo; Toma voiced the resolve of
both.</p>
<p>At twilight the boys saw a large party come in
from the north, in which there were a number of
whites. They were loaded down with furs, which
they probably had stolen. Dick thought he recognized
the figure of the half-breed Pierre Govereau,
but could not be certain at that distance.</p>
<p>Slowly darkness fell and the campfires flung out
flickering shadows on the sloping walls of tepees
and over the figures of the warriors squatted around
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;I make believe I one of them,&rdquo; Toma whispered
presently. &ldquo;I go down&mdash;find out where Sandy is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awful risk,&rdquo; Dick tried to object, &ldquo;and
you aren&rsquo;t dressed like they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fix that. You wait here&mdash;no, you come down
closer. Be ready to shoot, you hear trouble. Jump
&rsquo;round when you shoot. Make um think you whole
army. I ketch um Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Dick feared Toma would come to grief,
he could do nothing but let the courageous young
guide take the chance, hoping, if worst came to
worst, and Toma was discovered, that he might draw
the attention of the Indians long enough for his red
friend to escape.</p>
<p>Toma crawled off down the slope toward the
camp, Dick followed him for a little way, until he
reached a heavy copse of brush where he felt he
was within good rifle range of the camp. Toma
went on and disappeared, Dick&rsquo;s whispered wish of
&ldquo;good luck&rdquo; following him.</p>
<p>As Dick lay there waiting he could see on the side
of the camp nearest him, the shadowy figure of a
warrior sentinel, standing motionless by a tree, silhouetted
by the light of one of the fires. Dick raised
his rifle and drew bead on the guard. It was this
warrior who would discover Toma, if any did, and
Dick watched intently for a motion that would indicate
the guard had seen something unusual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>He watched for possibly five minutes, when of a
sudden another figure arose between him and the
shadowy guard. There was a swift movement of
the two shadows; they swayed violently, then the
guard fell and the other stooped over him. Then
both disappeared in the dark underbrush.</p>
<p>Dick held his breath. Toma had attacked the
guard and knocked him down. In a flash Dick saw
Toma&rsquo;s plan&mdash;the young Indian would change
clothes with the warrior and creep into the camp,
casually joining the others.</p>
<p>Gripping his rifle, Dick awaited developments.
What would happen in the next hour he did not
know, but he hoped for the best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">A SKIRMISH IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>Dick waited what seemed to him several hours,
though it could not have been more than thirty minutes,
before he saw a sign of Toma. Then, in almost
the exact position the guard had held, he saw a figure
rise up which he was almost certain was Toma,
though the firelight revealed that the young guide
now wore the clothes and head-dress of the sentinel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Toma,&rdquo; Dick whispered. &ldquo;Now
if you can only get in among them without them
recognizing that you&rsquo;re not really a member of their
band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma did not enter the camp from that side, however.
Once more he disappeared.</p>
<p>A patch of brush to the left caught Dick&rsquo;s roving
eyes, and this he watched, believing Toma would
take this means of getting into the camp without
attracting attention, since the bushes led up to a
point very near one of the tepees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>Dick was right. A few minutes later the bush
tops waved a little at the passage of a creeping body.
Presently in the shadow of the tepee nearest the
bushes, Toma rose and walked slowly toward one
of the campfires, where he joined a group. Dick
feared Toma might see the scar faced Indian, and
that the guide&rsquo;s desire for revenge might cause him
to destroy all his chances for the rescue of Sandy.
But as time passed and all went well, Dick felt that
Toma must be making good progress in the dangerous
mission he had set out on.</p>
<p>A little later Dick saw a figure, which he took to
be Toma, break away from a group of natives and
saunter toward one of the tepees. Evidently the
guide now was either looking for Sandy, or had
learned the captive&rsquo;s exact position from the conversation
of the warriors.</p>
<p>Toma stooped into the opening of the tepee and
disappeared. Holding his breath, Dick watched.
Toma was gone some time, then in the flickering
light he appeared again. Would Sandy follow?
Dick&rsquo;s heart beat painfully.</p>
<p>Then he could not suppress a low cry of exultation
as Sandy&rsquo;s bare head came out next and the
two slipped into the deep shadows of another tepee.
For minutes they did not move, then they suddenly
dashed for the patch of brush that had covered
Toma&rsquo;s entrance into the camp. Dick&rsquo;s finger tightened
on the trigger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>There was a commotion among one of the groups
about the campfires. A shout sounded, then a rifle
shot. The Indians began to run; they had seen
Toma and Sandy!</p>
<p>Dick took quick aim and fired. The crack of his
rifle in the silent forest startled the camp. Dick shot
again, hurrying to another position as Toma had
advised. He could see that Toma and Sandy had
reached cover, and that the guide was firing on his
pursuers.</p>
<p>The whole camp was in a turmoil now; Indians
and whites hurrying hither and thither, shooting at
the flashes of Dick&rsquo;s rifle. He could not hear what
they were shouting to each other, but he divined they
thought he was quite a number of men, so fast was
he firing and from so many positions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurry along toward Toma and Sandy,&rdquo; Dick
muttered to himself, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll know where I am by
the sound of my rifle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty yards further on Toma and Sandy
reached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re safe at last!&rdquo; Dick embraced
Sandy, while Toma kept up rifle fire on the Indians
and whites, who were now charging after them.</p>
<p>With a parting salvo at their pursuers, the three
made off into the night toward Fort Dunwoody.
All night they hurried on, hungry and tired, yet determined
to elude Govereau if they dropped in their tracks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Him Govereau with Indians,&rdquo; Toma revealed to
Dick. &ldquo;No see um Many-Scar Jackson. I hear um
talk much. Bear Henderson, him make north country
big nation all his own. Give Indians back their
land. Humph! Bear Henderson crazy&mdash;him thief,
outlaw. That Govereau bad fella too; keep um police
from come up from south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not take Sandy long to tell Dick and Toma
how he had been captured by two scouts of Govereau&rsquo;s
band, who had lain in hiding, looking for a
chance to attack. It had been their approach and
the appearance of a herd of caribou going south
that had frightened away the wolves. Dick had
been right in suspecting that Sandy had walked in
his sleep. It was almost funny to hear him tell how
he had awakened, struggling in the hands of his captors,
dreaming they were wolves devouring him.</p>
<p>At dawn the travelers reached the shores of a
large lake, whose snow covered ice stretched for
leagues and leagues ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him Badge Lake,&rdquo; Toma told them. &ldquo;We cross
um ice, make journey shorter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>They stopped long enough to steep coffee and
make some flapjacks. Dick and Toma had taken
very few provisions with them when they left Gaston
Leroi, and they now could see that they would have
barely enough for another meal.</p>
<p>Still hungry, they set off across the frozen lake
with many a backward glance to see if they were followed.
But if they were, they saw no sign of Govereau&rsquo;s
band. The silent forest, fading from view
as they forged out farther and farther over the ice,
disclosed no running figures on their trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cross um lake when sun set,&rdquo; Toma said.
&ldquo;Maybe see moose when other side. We eat then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long jaunt across the lake. At noon they
could see the other shore, dim and hazy to the south.
With hunger gnawing at their vitals they trudged
the last miles across the ice, hearing now and again,
a low rumbling roar as the lake ice cracked open for
hundreds and hundreds of yards. Once they were
held up by one of these cracks, wider than the rest,
which they could not leap over. They had to follow
this until it grew narrower. Sandy slipped when
they finally jumped the crack, and fell into the niche.
At the bottom the fissure came together, and was
partly filled with slivers of ice. Dick and Toma
pulled Sandy out on the end of a rifle.</p>
<p>Darkness was just falling when they reached the
other shore of the lake. It was with groans of
thankfulness that they built a fire and dropped down
to rest for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all in,&rdquo; Sandy sank upon his back by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have gone much further,&rdquo; Dick admitted.</p>
<p>Even Toma seemed tired. They did not bother
to get supper, but rolled into their sleeping bags, and
fell into heavy slumber, not even keeping watch.</p>
<p>Dawn found them awake. They finished their
provisions for breakfast, and again took to the trail
on the last lap to Fort Dunwoody. They had no
time to hunt, but kept watch among the trees for
a ptarmigan or partridge, or bigger game if they
ran across it. But they had bad luck and the entire
day passed with no more than two ptarmigan to
show for their pains.</p>
<p>The birds made a slender meal for the three
hungry young men. Toma chopped out some roots
that proved succulent when stewed, and they managed
to fill their stomachs with this, though within
an hour afterwards they were as hungry as ever.</p>
<p>Twenty miles from Fort Dunwoody, at noon of
the third day since the rescue of Sandy, they came
abruptly upon a friendly Indian village at the edge
of a tiny lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll eat!&rdquo; cried the haggard Sandy.</p>
<p>And eat they did, in preparation for the last lap
of their eventful journey, for they felt it would be
a hard day on the trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">GRAY GOOSE LAKE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The fort! The fort!&rdquo; cheered Dick, as the following
evening they came to the edge of a vast plain.</p>
<p>Sandy was overjoyed, so much so that he could
not speak.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a half mile ahead frowned the stockade
of Fort Dunwoody, under the rippling flag of
the king. Toma did not express himself in words,
but hastened his tireless pace.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy hurried after the guide, curiously
gazing at the fort. Along the top of the stockade
they could see a red-coated policeman pacing slowly
back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; the sentry above the gate
called when the worn travelers appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re from Fort du Lac&mdash;looking
for help at Fort Good Faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the lads that helped bring in Corporal Richardson?&rdquo;
the sentry gruffly asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>The huge gate swung back immediately, and the
young adventurers passed through. The police guard
met them as the gate was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want to see Inspector Dawson?&rdquo; asked the
guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s the man we should see,&rdquo; Dick replied.</p>
<p>Presently they were ushered into the presence of
Inspector Dawson, whose grim face, under a thatch
of iron gray hair, broke into a smile, meant to be
kind.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy gave the scout salute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo; said the Inspector, &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve been
members of the Boy Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, first class, both of us,&rdquo; replied Dick, a
little abashed in the presence of so distinguished a
man as Inspector Dawson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal Richardson told me about you,&rdquo; went
on the Inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the corporal got in all right,&rdquo; Dick exulted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thanks to you boys and Gaston Leroi,&rdquo; Inspector
Dawson said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be up and around in a
few days now. I&rsquo;ve already sent relief to Fort Good
Faith,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Dick was both glad and disappointed at
once. He had hoped to join the expedition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;However, an Indian runner came in today saying
that Sergeant Brewster and Constable Marden, the
two I detailed for Fort Good Faith, were held up at
Gray Goose Lake by one of Henderson&rsquo;s lieutenants
and about thirty renegade Indians. I believe the
man&rsquo;s name is Pierre Govereau. He has a criminal
record here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Govereau!&rdquo; ejaculated Dick and Sandy in one
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have met him before,&rdquo; the Inspector
continued briskly. &ldquo;But the point I&rsquo;m getting at is
this; I have no men to send on as relief to Gray
Goose Lake. I expect one of my scouts, Malemute
Slade, in tomorrow morning from Fort du Lac
where he has cleared things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mention of Malemute Slade, Dick and Sandy
exchanged significant glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the inspector continued. &ldquo;And I suppose
you follows want to go on to Fort Good Faith.
You seem to be able to take care of yourselves.
Would you like to be special deputies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would we!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Sandy.</p>
<p>Inspector Dawson could not forbear a smile at the
boys&rsquo; exuberance. &ldquo;All right, step forward,&rdquo; he
commanded, arising from his desk.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy lined up like soldiers while they
repeated the oath of allegiance to the law on specials
duty for the duration of the Henderson outbreak.</p>
<p>The Inspector made Toma an official scout.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now good day, boys,&rdquo; the Inspector said dismissing
them. &ldquo;Report to me tomorrow morning
early. I expect Slade in then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy followed Toma out of headquarters
seething with excitement. They felt themselves
full-fledged mounted policemen now, and, too,
they were to take the trail with Malemute Slade, the
famous scout they had met on the Big Smokey.
Their only regret was that they could not don the
beautiful uniforms they saw everywhere about the
post.</p>
<p>They inquired as to the quarters of Corporal Richardson,
and had a long chat with the convalescent
officer. They secured arrangements to pass the
night in the barracks, and once more toasted their
shins before a genuine stove.</p>
<p>Bright and early next morning, Dick and Sandy
rolled out of their bunks and pulled on their clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hardly seems possible we&rsquo;re at Fort Dunwoody,&rdquo;
Dick declared when they attacked the ample
breakfast set before them by the post cook.</p>
<p>Sandy shivered in recalling the narrow escapes
they had had and agreed with Dick.</p>
<p>Toma, who had slept before the fire on a bearskin
rug, was as silent as he always was when off the
trail, but his moon face was split by a continuous
smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>Malemute Slade was waiting at headquarters
when the boys reported as instructed. His dog team
of six huge huskies stood in front of the Inspector&rsquo;s
office, harnessed to the sled, ready for the trail.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy were pleased to find that Malemute
Slade remembered them. His dark, wind-hardened
face lighted up pleasantly, as he shook
hands with his future trail mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, I swan,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll do
some tall fightin&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy assured him they were with him
with all they had to offer, and after Inspector Dawson
had wished them good luck, they mushed across
the parade square to the stockade gate, which swung
slowly open for them.</p>
<p>Hour after hour the relief detachment from the
post traveled northward. Malemute Slade would
not permit the boys to sleep longer than five hours.
Long before dawn they were up, had eaten a hasty
breakfast, while the dogs wolfed their daily frozen
fish, and had hit the trail again. Dick and Sandy
had grown almost as trail hardened as Toma on their
long trip from Fort du Lac to Fort Dunwoody, and
they did not complain at the terrific pace set by Malemute
Slade.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>On the afternoon of the third day, more than a
hundred miles north of Fort Dunwoody, they saw
from the top of a ridge the white, level expanse of
Gray Goose Lake. They had not been molested
along the way and they decided that Govereau was
doing all his fighting at Gray Goose Lake.</p>
<p>Around the lake they broke into rough and serrated
country, through which they proceeded cautiously.
Soon they heard the faint report of rifles,
by which they located the scene of combat.</p>
<p>Malemute Slade led the way up a long ravine
where they left the dog team in charge of Toma and
went on under cover of whatever they found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me, lads, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t fire till I give the
word,&rdquo; Malemute Slade ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! There they are!&rdquo; whispered Dick a moment
later as they reached the top of the ravine.</p>
<p>On a rocky knoll, overlooking Gray Goose Lake,
they could see the occasional puff of two rifles. All
around the bottom of the little hill were hidden
Govereau&rsquo;s men, flanked by a deep gorge on their
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, lads, we&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em on the run. Shoot an&rsquo;
holler all you can,&rdquo; Malemute Slade&rsquo;s drawling voice
calmed them.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy tensed for the coming skirmish,
tightening their grips of their rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; called Malemute Slade. &ldquo;Here we go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>They broke from cover and ran yelling like an
army across the space that separated them from
Govereau&rsquo;s party. The Indians turned and shouted,
seeming paralyzed with surprise. The besieged
policemen, on the hill, seeing reinforcements, also
charged, leaping from their hiding place and firing
as they came.</p>
<p>Attacked from two sides, Govereau&rsquo;s band broke
and fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Govereau!&rdquo; cried Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; here&rsquo;s where one dirty skunk cashes in,&rdquo;
shouted Malemute Slade, raising his high-powered
rifle. At the report of the rifle, Govereau fell, Dick
and Sandy rushing past his body in pursuit of the
others.</p>
<p>Dick barely had witnessed the fall of Govereau
before he caught sight of Toma stalking an Indian,
who was trying to crawl away among the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt, in the king&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; commanded Dick, as
he recognized the skulker to be no other than Many-Scar
Jackson.</p>
<p>But the scar faced Indian did not halt. He broke
into a run toward the deep gorge on the left, Toma
in hot pursuit, and Dick and Sandy close behind.</p>
<p>Suddenly Dick stopped dead in his tracks, Sandy
almost falling over him. &ldquo;Toma!&rdquo; he called, but the
guide did not seem to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to avenge his brother&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; Sandy
exclaimed, pushing ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Dick hauled his chum back. &ldquo;Toma
doesn&rsquo;t want us to interfere. It&rsquo;s his fight. If we
see he&rsquo;s getting the worst of it, then we&rsquo;ll help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandy drew back and with pale faces they watched
the two Indians come together and draw their knives
in a duel to the death.</p>
<p>Around and around they circled before Toma
darted in like a flash and drew blood. But Many-Scar
made a stab in return, and they saw Toma
reel a little. Then the two clinched, staggered this
way, then that, their knife blades locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many-Scar has him!&rdquo; Sandy suddenly exclaimed,
raising his rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Dick cried.</p>
<p>For a moment it had seemed as if the scar faced
Indian would plunge his knife into Toma&rsquo;s breast,
but the agile young guide twisted suddenly, like a
snake, and Many-Scar was tripped to his knees.</p>
<p>Then as Toma leaped in to follow up his advantage,
Many-Scar whirled away, leaped to his feet and
once more they circled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many-Scar is getting the worst of it,&rdquo; Dick
breathed a few moments later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure is,&rdquo; agreed Sandy exultingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s enemy plainly was weakening. Dick and
Sandy prepared to see the final thrust, when of a
sudden the scar faced Indian broke away and ran
like the wind straight toward the gorge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll fall into the gorge!&rdquo; Dick cried, starting
to run toward them.</p>
<p>But Many-Scar Jackson and Toma, too, seemed
uncognizant of any immediate danger from a fall.
Many-Scar ran like a deer, and as he reached the
edge, he leaped into the air. Like a bird he soared
across the space between the two cliffs, landing safely
on the other side, where he vanished into the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a jump!&rdquo; exclaimed Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; Sandy said amazedly. &ldquo;Why,
it was a broad jump record. It&rsquo;s nearly thirty feet
between the cliffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma had halted on the brink of the cliff and the
boys saw him raise clinched fists to the sky. Toma
had failed this time, but, somehow, the boys felt
sure there was another time coming.</p>
<p>Behind them Malemute Slade was calling. They
rejoined the victorious mounted police, Toma tardily
returning.</p>
<p>Presently they were behind the dogs on the trail
to Fort Good Faith, their party now increased to
five with Sergeant Brewster and Constable Marden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Uncle Walter has been able to hold out
this long,&rdquo; Sandy whispered to himself as he ran
after the waving tails of the huskies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">CHIEF BLACK DOG&rsquo;S SCHEME</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming into an Indian village,&rdquo; Dick
called to Sandy, when the party reached the top of a
long ridge.</p>
<p>Sandy, who was some distance in the rear, hurried
up and joined Dick. A village of nearly a score of
tepees lay ahead, the smoke of a number of campfires
rising here and there.</p>
<p>Sergeant Brewster, who had taken command, explained
that he was about to enlist the tribe&rsquo;s aid in
an effort at retaking Fort Good Faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief Black Dog is a good friend of the mounted,&rdquo;
said Sergeant Brewster, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;ll let us have a
few warriors. I suppose Henderson has tried to get
the old fellow on his side, but chief is loyal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the village, and had some trouble
with the numberless Indian dogs that rushed out savagely
from behind the tepees and attacked the
huskies. Presently several Indians came and called
off the dogs, throwing stones and sticks at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Sergeant Brewster addressed one of the braves:
&ldquo;Tell Chief Black Dog a man from the Great White
Father has come to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The buck hurried away, and soon returned, saying
the chief would be glad to see him, in fact had invited
them all to his council tepee.</p>
<p>Leaving Toma to look after the dogs, Dick and
Sandy followed Malemute Slade and the policemen
to a tepee much larger than the rest. The entrance
was so high that even Malemute Slade entered erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, it&rsquo;s dark,&rdquo; whispered Sandy, when the tepee
flap closed behind them.</p>
<p>The only light in the tepee was a tiny fire glowing
in the center. Before this Dick and Sandy could
make out three shadowy figures. The one in the
center was an aged Indian with snow white hair. He
was Chief Black Dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white brother comes from the Great White
Father. It is good. Peace with white brother,&rdquo; the
old chief spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We bring presents from the great chief to the
big chief,&rdquo; Sergeant Brewster announced, drawing
from his mackinaw pockets a fine pocket knife and
a shining tobacco box.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy could see the old chief&rsquo;s eyes glitter
as they fell upon the gifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; said Chief Black Dog, accepting the
presents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>The sergeant also gave something to each of the
two chiefs seated on either side of Chief Black Dog,
for which they muttered thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the white brother have?&rdquo; the chief
spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wish help to fight the bad outlaw, Bear Henderson,&rdquo;
answered the sergeant. &ldquo;He has taken
Fort Good Faith from the good factor Walter MacClaren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good. My warriors are brave. They go
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Brewster thanked the old chief, then
waited for dismissal. Chief Black Dog sat looking
into the fire for a time, his deep eyes meditative.
The boys watched curiously. The chief seemed to
be thinking. At length he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red man would know how many braves the
bad chief Henderson fights with. Some my warriors,
young and foolish, with Henderson. I send
warrior in night. He go make believe join Henderson.
He find his brothers there. He find out how
many braves hold fort. Come tell me. He find
where big chief MacClaren in prison. We know
how to fight better then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The red man&rsquo;s words are wise,&rdquo; replied the sergeant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; the chief said, turning to the chief on
his left and speaking swiftly in his native tongue.</p>
<p>The other chief rose and quietly left the tepee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White brother&rsquo;s men stay, wait for spy, when he
come back. One night maybe. Then we know all.&rdquo;
He waved a withered hand in dismissal.</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy welcomed the open air, when once
again they stepped into the sunlight. At the sergeant&rsquo;s
orders they helped Toma unharness the dogs.</p>
<p>Chief Black Dog assigned two tepees to the
party from Fort Dunwoody. Dick, Sandy and
Toma took one, the mounted policemen the other.
An hour later the boys watched the spy leave for
Fort Good Faith, while the war drums of the tribe
summoned the braves to battle.</p>
<p>It was an exciting evening the boys passed, watching
the warriors in their fantastic dances. When at
last they went to their tepee to rest, they were tired,
but could not sleep. The wait for news from Fort
Good Faith was proving to be a trying one. So near
Sandy&rsquo;s uncle, yet under orders to remain idle, the
boys chafed and worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; Sandy cried. &ldquo;I want to get
there and have it over with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know just how you feel,&rdquo; sympathized Dick.
&ldquo;I want to smell powder too. But I believe the chief
made a wise move, at that. What do you think,
Toma?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s dark face, lighted by the fire, brightened.
&ldquo;Him wise chief,&rdquo; said Toma. &ldquo;My father know
him long ago when they hunt on Saskatchewan
River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us a story about the old days, Toma,&rdquo; Dick
pleaded, as he squatted by the fire, &ldquo;&mdash;an Indian
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; Sandy chimed in.</p>
<p>The young guide seemed to be looking far away
as he stared into the glowing coals. Outside, the
war drums and the cries of the dancing warriors
echoed in the forest aisles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell story my father tell me long ago, when I
little boy,&rdquo; Toma began. &ldquo;Big medicine man tell
my father. It is story of Saskatchewan River and
Great Bear, mighty hunter of the Crees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long ago, by Saskatchewan live big tribe. One
hunter, one Great Bear, he mightier than all big
hunters. Him not like Saskatchewan country. Him
want travel far, far&mdash;where sun goes down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big medicine man, one Two-Horns-in-the-Bone
not want lose Great Bear, great hunter. Him try
keep Great Bear home. But Great Bear don&rsquo;t care.
He go anyway, he say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then Great Bear get ready go far away. When
start, Two-Horns-in-the-Bone go &rsquo;long little way
with Great Bear, so Great Spirit be with him in far
lands. They stop on bank of Saskatchewan, mighty
river. Great Bear, lie thirsty. He kneel down, fill
up with water. Two-Horns-in-the-Bone make sign
over him, big medicine sign. When Great Bear get
up, medicine man say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They who drink waters of Saskatchewan shall
return before they die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Bear, him laugh. Him think Two-Horns-in-the-Bone
make fun. Great Bear young, strong;
he laugh at Great Spirit, like him laugh at grizzly.
Him leap in Saskatchewan an&rsquo; swim across. Him
wave spear goodbye to medicine man, an&rsquo; turn back
on Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two-Horns-in-the-Bone go back to tepee. Say
nothing. Him very wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many moons pass. Great Bear go far, far away&mdash;to
Big Sea, to desert, to other side of sunset. He
fight many battles, always win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine man by Saskatchewan, him wait an&rsquo;
smoke long pipe. Twenty winters gone by, then
spring come. Two-Horns-in-the-Bone walk down
to Saskatchewan. He wait all day. When sunset
come he see old man walking. Old man all bent
over, white hair, hobble on stick. Two-Horns-in-the-Bone
watch. Old man come down to edge of
water. Him kneel down and drink. Then he go
back and lay down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two-Horns-in-the-Bone go to old man. Him
speak, him look in face. Old Indian, him Great
Bear. Old medicine man raise face to sky. &lsquo;The
Great Spirit has spoken,&rsquo; say Two-Horns-in-the-Bone.
&lsquo;They who drink waters of Saskatchewan
shall return before they die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toma&rsquo;s voice died out. The young Indian seemed
to be in another land, as he thought of his father&rsquo;s
people. Dick and Sandy sat spell-bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Legend of the Saskatchewan,&rdquo; Dick
said in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure was a good story,&rdquo; said Sandy. &ldquo;Tell us
another one, Toma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Toma shook his head. Dick and Sandy saw
a certain sadness in his face, that the legend had
aroused, and they did not urge him. Presently they
rolled into their blankets. Once asleep, they did not
awaken until summoned by Sergeant Brewster.</p>
<p>As they hurried from the tepee on the morning
of that day which was to mean so much, an inspiring
sight greeted their eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">THE ATTACK ON THE FORT</span></h2>
<p>The tepees of the Indian village were arranged
in a hollow square, and in the midst of this were
gathered more than fifty warriors, arrayed for battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a fearful sight!&rdquo; exclaimed Sandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to have them catch me alone in the forest,&rdquo;
Dick responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll help us do for Henderson,&rdquo; Sergeant
Brewster remarked at their elbow. &ldquo;The spy came
in an hour ago. He reports that Henderson has
about ten half-breeds and thirty Indians holding the
fort. They don&rsquo;t dream of an attack. Henderson
thinks Govereau is taking care of the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the spy find out anything about Uncle Walter?&rdquo;
Sandy queried anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming to that,&rdquo; continued the sergeant.
&ldquo;It seems that Henderson has imprisoned him in a
cave about a mile from the fort. The spy believes
he can find the cave from what he overheard while
inside the stockade. I&rsquo;ll detail you fellows to go
after the factor. But don&rsquo;t leave until we&rsquo;re sure
we&rsquo;ve taken the fort&mdash;that comes first. Toma and
Malemute Slade will accompany, with the spy as a
guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were interrupted by Malemute Slade and
Constable Marden driving up with the dog team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, boys,&rdquo; grinned Malemute Slade, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re off
for another tussle. As f&rsquo;r me I can&rsquo;t get to it too
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick and Sandy laughed and fell into line. The
band of Indians already had started out. They left
the village amid the lamentations of Indian women
and the loud barking of the dogs.</p>
<p>They traveled slowly, Sergeant Brewster explaining
that they must not reach Fort Good Faith until
nightfall, if they were to surprise Henderson. Scouts
were sent on ahead to report any appearance of Henderson&rsquo;s
men.</p>
<p>Just before dark the war party came to a halt on
the slope of a hill, from the top of which they could
see Fort Good Faith not far away. Dick and Sandy
gazed upon the stockade in awe. They had traveled
more than six hundred miles since leaving Fort du
Lac, and at last within sight of the post, they felt
rewarded for all the hardships they had gone through
in an effort to rescue Sandy&rsquo;s uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep out of sight till after dark&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all that bothers me,&rdquo; chafed Sandy. &ldquo;I wish
we were climbing the stockade right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Brewster called to them just then.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the spy,&rdquo; he presented a somber Indian.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll stay close by you until it&rsquo;s time for you to go
after your uncle. Take your orders from Malemute
Slade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worked up to a frenzy by their war dances, the
warriors were eager to attack, and it was all the
policemen and the chiefs could do to hold them back
until nightfall.</p>
<p>The minutes seemed like hours. But darkness
slowly fell, and the hour of the attack approached.
The Indians grew quieter then. At a word from the
sergeant the war party started on toward the fort.</p>
<p>All was silent until they were under the very walls
of the stockade, then the Indians gave vent to a horrible
war cry, and like so many chipmunks clambered
over the stockade. The first inside rushed the guard
at the gate and swung it open for the rest of the
party. Rifles and revolvers flashed in the darkness
everywhere, and combined with the cries of the Indians,
made a deafening racket.</p>
<p>Dick dropped down from the top of the palisades
on the heels of Malemute Slade, Sandy and Toma
following him. Suddenly he heard Sandy cry out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help, Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Dick turned and ran toward the sound, his rifle
clubbed in his hands. In the gloom he could see
Sandy struggling in the grip of a brawny half-breed,
Dick&rsquo;s gun stock swept down, and Sandy&rsquo;s adversary
rolled over and lay still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Sandy. Let&rsquo;s not lose Malemute,&rdquo;
Dick called.</p>
<p>They could see the policemen concentrating their
attack on the door of the post residence, which had
been hastily barricaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up an&rsquo; at &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Malemute bellowed as he rushed
to join the mounted police. Three half-breeds
leaped out of the shadows and barred the big scout&rsquo;s
way. Malemute fired once, swung his fists twice,
and the half-breeds were trampled underfoot.</p>
<p>The surprise attack was over as quickly as it had
begun. Dick and Sandy saw a huge, long-haired
man come to the door in answer to the sergeant&rsquo;s
demand for surrender, and watched the handcuffs
snapped upon the outlaw&rsquo;s wrists. It was the first
look at the man behind all the trouble. Henderson&rsquo;s
name fitted him, they decided. He looked much like
a grizzly in man&rsquo;s clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t half a fight,&rdquo; Malemute Slade complained.
&ldquo;Now if that pesky spy would show up
we&rsquo;d skip out for the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The Indian spy and Toma both were approaching
at a run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on there,&rdquo; Malemute sang out to the spy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be a&rsquo;ter the factor now&mdash;double quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Led by the spy, the five left the stockade in the
hands of the mounted police, and hurried off into the
night.</p>
<p>It was hard going through the deep snow, but the
spy seemed to be sure of the way. Only once did
the Indian seem confused. Then he paused while
the rest waited impatiently. Then they were off
again.</p>
<p>Presently they came to a narrow canyon. Dick,
Sandy and Toma were running close together. Malemute
Slade and the Indian spy were slightly in the
lead.</p>
<p>Suddenly the spy stopped dead, emitting a guttural
exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down!&rdquo; cried Malemute.</p>
<p>Scarcely had all five dropped flat when a hoarse
voice sounded, seemingly out of the wall of the canyon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll shore find out in a minute,&rdquo; retorted Malemute
boldly. &ldquo;Jest come out where we can see the
color o&rsquo; y&rsquo;r whiskers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you think much of y&rsquo;r hide you better skidaddle,&rdquo;
replied the voice, threateningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haw, haw,&rdquo; called Malemute. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be the one
to do the skidaddlin&rsquo; when we finish with yuh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence followed, while Dick strained his eyes to
see from whence the voice came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the cave,&rdquo; Sandy whispered.</p>
<p>Nerves at snapping pitch, the young adventurers
awaited the orders of the scout, who was mumbling
to himself. Malemute was about to order a blind
advance, when four dark forms leaped out of the
rocks behind them. Dick Kent had a momentary
vision of Malemute Slade pinned under two men,
then something crashed down upon his head and all
went black.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">LOST UNDERGROUND</span></h2>
<p>Dick Kent regained consciousness slowly. His
head pained severely, and as he passed his hand
through his hair his fingers encountered something
warm and sticky. All was silent in the canyon. He
sat up with a start, all coming back to him&mdash;the mysterious
voice from the canyon wall, the surprise attack,
the blow that had felled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy! Sandy!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely. But the
dark canyon gave back his voice in a hollow echo.
There was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have they gone?&rdquo; Dick wondered. &ldquo;Have
they been killed or captured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got dizzily to his feet and stumbled along the
canyon, feeling his way. Almost immediately, he
felt a depression in the rock. In the starlight a dark
hole yawned in the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cave!&rdquo; he exulted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>Just then he stumbled over something solid, yet
yielding. Groping about his feet, he recoiled in horror.
It was the face of a man! In the starlight he
finally made out the body, and saw that it was not
one of his party.</p>
<p>Again Dick called out Sandy&rsquo;s name, but only the
echo of his voice from the yawning cavern answered
him.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s head was clearing now. He thought swiftly
and concluded his companions must have gone into
the cavern in search of Walter MacClaren. He
turned in and groped his way along, calling every
now and then. Once he thought he heard a shout
and stopped, but all was silent.</p>
<p>He had a few matches in his pocket and he drew
one out and lighted it. He found himself in a large
cave, evidently formed by the erosion of water. The
roof of the cavern was some six feet higher than his
head. Where he was standing there seemed but one
passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t get lost if there&rsquo;s only the main
passage,&rdquo; Dick decided, and started on boldly, feeling
his way in the blackness.</p>
<p>The cavern slanted downward slightly, and leading
forward fairly straight, Dick made good time,
though he tested every bit of footing to make certain
he did not step off into a hole, or run into an
obstruction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>Presently he could hear running water, and as the
sound grew louder, he lighted another match. There
was no disturbance of air and the flame burned steadily.
Dick could see that the cavern branched at this
point. Down one passage a swift stream of dark
water flowed; the other was dry.</p>
<p>About to take to the cavern that was dry underfoot,
Dick heard a shout somewhere in the cave before
him. He thrilled as he recognized Sandy&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy, Sandy, here I am!&rdquo; he answered at the
top of his lungs, hurrying down the cavern from
which he believed the voice had come. Once more
he heard Sandy&rsquo;s shout, but this time it was fainter.
Then he heard it no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be tracks if anyone has passed here,&rdquo;
Dick thought, and striking a match, stooped down.
Plainly, in the moist floor of the cavern, were the
tracks of moccasins. But they were directed both
forward and back, and meant very little.</p>
<p>Thinking to catch Sandy before he was too far
away, Dick hastened forward with less caution. He
had advanced some fifty yards, when of a sudden the
earth gave way under him. His cry of terror was
drowned by the sound of falling stones and gravel,
as he pitched downward. His clutching hands encountered
a rim of solid rock. With a painful jerk
he stopped his fall, dangling there by his fingers over
a chasm he knew not how deep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Once he regained his breath and sense, he endeavored
to pull himself up. But he could not quite make
it. The hole bulged outward under his feet and,
kick and thresh as he would, he could not get a foothold
anywhere. The rim he was clinging to was so
narrow that it was impossible for him to hold his
body up on it even if he pulled himself up by the
hands. He realized that he was part way down the
hole, hanging to the conical wall.</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s struggles slowly weakened. His head was
paining him severely. He realized that he could not
hang on much longer, yet gritting his teeth, he clung
on while his muscles burned and his fingers grew
numb.</p>
<p>With his last remaining strength, he shouted. But
it seemed that his voice was deadened by the formation
of the hole, as if he had shouted into a barrel.
But again and again he raised his voice, though it
grew weaker and weaker.</p>
<p>He did not know whether he imagined it or not,
but he thought his last outcry received an answer.
Slowly he was losing consciousness. It seemed that
he could hear the pad, pad of moccasins and more
voices. A hand grasped his wrists, then he gave out.</p>
<p>When once more Dick awakened he found himself
in a dimly lighted underground room. Some one
was pouring something hot between his teeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sandy!&rdquo; he started up, looking into his chum&rsquo;s
happy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetin&rsquo;s, lad,&rdquo; called Malemute Slade, smiling
down from the other side of him, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had a
tough time of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was all over with as far as I was
concerned,&rdquo; replied Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Walter is here, but he&rsquo;s pretty sick,&rdquo; Sandy
was telling him. &ldquo;We found him in this room, almost
dead from starvation. He seems to be a little
better since we fed him some hot broth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick raised up, his aching head swimming.
Across the room, watched over by Toma, on a heap
of balsam boughs, he saw a bearded man, haggard
of face. It was Walter MacClaren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I can stand on my pins now,&rdquo; declared
Dick. &ldquo;But where did you all go right after I was
knocked out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devils drove us right into the cave,&rdquo; volunteered
Malemute Slade. &ldquo;It was a running fight till
I climbed on a shelf of rock an&rsquo; dropped down on the
beans of a couple of &rsquo;em. I cracked their pates, then
we choked the other one till he told us where the
lad&rsquo;s uncle was. Me&mdash;I guess I&rsquo;ve got about all I
want of fightin&rsquo; for today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you shouting,&rdquo; Sandy explained, &ldquo;but you
were in the wrong branch of the cavern. I had to
go clear down to the fork before I found where you
were. You had just about let go of the rock. I
was scared to death when I had pulled you out. I
struck a match&mdash;and say!&mdash;that hole didn&rsquo;t seem to
have any bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick shuddered, but smiled grimly. He had had a
close shave&mdash;they had all had a close shave&mdash;but
things had come out right in the end.</p>
<p>Malemute Slade had located the store of food kept
by MacClaren&rsquo;s guards, and they sat down and had
a bite to eat. Then, they all gathered anxiously
around Walter MacClaren. With eyes shining,
Sandy stooped forward and patted his uncle&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is all right now,&rdquo; the youth muttered
happily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that Uncle Walt will get better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several minutes they stood there in the half-light,
looking down at the recumbent figure of the
man, whose life they had saved barely in the nick of
time. Except for their quiet breathing and the low
trickle of water in an alcove close at hand, the deep
hush remained unbroken. Then, unexpectedly, MacClaren
stirred, muttering in his sleep. His eyes
blinked open.</p>
<p>His gaze wavered from one to the other of the
little company gathered around him, and slowly a
smile played across his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;Up in a few days,&rdquo; he managed to articulate
weakly. &ldquo;Thanks&mdash;everyone of you! I&rsquo;ll be feeling
fine in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, with another smile, he rolled over on his
side and went back to sleep. In a surge of new-found
happiness, Dick nodded significantly at Sandy,
and, arm-in-arm, they turned quietly and tip-toed out
of the room.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
